3.1.  General .   
 
3.1.1.  Flight Briefings .  A weather  briefing and a N otices to Airman (NOTAMs) 
briefing/update is required for every  flight.  Flight leads are also responsible for adequately 
briefing  Special Interest Items (SIIs) and applicable FCIFs before all flights .  For quick-
turns/pits/multiple flights, the Operations Supervisor and/or SOF will ensure pilots are 
informed of any s ignificant changes to their initial weather briefing or factor NOTAMs.  
 3.1.2.  Basic Risk Management (RM) procedures are IAW  
AFI 90 -802_ACCSUP, Risk 
Management , paragraph 2.10. and the following: 
 3.1.2.1.  20 OG RM assessment worksheets
 must be filled out before every flight briefing.  
 3.1.2.2.  Flight leads are responsible for determining the particular risks associated with their planned/backup missions, including individual pilot risk factors (fatigue, 
experience, proficiency, etc.) .  The Operations Supervisor (or appropriate RM approval 
authority) will review 20 OG RM assessment worksheets and discuss applicable risk/mitigations with the flight lead prior to step .  The RM approval authority must 
understand and concur with the level of risk/mitigations the pilot  is accepting .  The 
approval authority may elect to make changes to the profile or ultimately cancel the sortie based on the associated risk .   
 3.1.2.3.  Operations Supervisors and Aircrew will continually assess and update RM decisions throughout the duration of the sortie to account for developing risks such as maintenance delays, real world taskings, weather, flight profile changes, etc .   
 3.1.2.4.  Units will keep RM worksheets on file for 1 month for lookback purposes in the event of a mishap or maintenance finding .   
 
3.1.2.5.  Additional 20 OG RM Worksheet procedures:  
3.1.2.5.1.  Paper copy RM assessment worksheets for each flight will be placed next to the AF IMT 4327 (sign- out sheet).  Each pilot will fill out their individual 
“PERSON” risk factors prior to the flight brief .  Flight leads (or #3’s) will review 
RM worksheets and ensure relevant mission risk factors and/or any additional individual “PERSON” risk factors are addressed during the flight brief.    3.1.2.5.2.  Under “PERSON” factor s, combine scores for all flight members .   
 3.1.2.5.3.  RM sheets will be turned into the Operations Supervisor prior to step for review and approval.

water, not Shaw AFB ai r temperature.  
 3.1.6.  Ice FOD .  When an Ice FOD Alert is issued, follow procedures located in the 
20 FW 
IFG.  Make an AFTO 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flig ht Data Document, write -up anytime 
icing (ground or air) is encountered. 
 3.1.7.  ECM Pod Operations.  For training missions, if the ECM pod does not successfully time-in and Standby (STBY) status is not achieved prior to takeoff, Operations Supervisor 
approval is required to continue the mission.  Pilots will leave the pod in STBY and make an 
AFTO 781 write -up after the flight for “possible cold soak condition.”   If the pod is discovered 
in the OFF position in- flight, turn the pod on above 10,000 feet MSL.  If the pod times in 
prior to descending below 10,000 feet MSL , then no cold soak condition exists.  Use the same 
procedures above for a HTS pod that does not power up.  The left hardpoint should be kept ON after troubleshooting a sick HTS pod. Pilots will ensure a non-combat program is loaded when using the ECM pod in training.

appropriate VFR ATC RADAR services will be provided until the pilot either receives range clearance or cancels the service.  
 A5.1.3.  Poinsett R -6002 Entry Procedures. 
 
A5.1.3.1.  Coordinate with RAPCON or the Range Control Officer (RCO) prior to 
entering R -6002. 
 A5.1.3.2.  Upon communications transfer to the RCO, the pilot’s IFR clearance is 
canceled and RADAR services are terminated.  
 A5.1.3.3.  The RCO provides clearance into R -6002 on frequency 264.7. 
 A5.1.3.4.  Flight leads will retain the ATC assigned squawk code and wingmen will 
squawk 400X in sequence. 
 A5.1.4.  Poinsett R -6002 Exit Procedures.
