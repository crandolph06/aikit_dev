GENERAL GUIDANCE 
1.1. Roles and Responsibilities. This manual prescribes procedures for operating F -16 aircraft 
under most circumstances. It is not a substitute for sound judgment. Procedures not specifically 
addressed may be accomplished if they enhance safe and effective mission  accomplishment.  
1.1.1. Commanders.  Commander s at their respective tier levels  are responsible  for complying 
with guidance in this manual. (T -1). F -16 flying unit wing commanders, delegated no lower 
than Operations Group Commander (or equivalent), are responsible for providing local 
operating guidance to supplement the requirements of this Manual. (T-1). 
1.1.2. Pilot in Command Authority. The pilot in command is responsible for, and is the final 
authority for the operation of the aircraft.  (T-1). Pilots  will use best judgement  to safely  conduct 
flying operations. (T-1). 
1.2. Waivers. Forward waiver requests through appropriate channels to the applicable 
MAJCOM/A3 or equivalent, or Commander Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) for those aircrew and assets under  the COMAFFOR’s  oversight, for approval. The COMAFFOR,  MAJCOM/A3  (or 
equivalent) will notify ACC/A3 of waivers within 72 hours of issuance. Wing commanders will notify the publication OPR within 72 hours of waiver approval (T -2). In accordance with AFI  33- 
360, a copy of the approved waiver must follow within 30 days of issuance (T -2). An email to  the 
waived publication OPR that includes a completed AF Form 679, Air Force Publication 
Compliance Item Waiver Request/Approval or equivalent will suffice. Waiver authority for supplemental guidance will be as specifi ed in the supplement and approved through higher level 
coordination  authority.

Section 2A —General  Chapter 2 
MISSION PLANNING  
 
2.1. Responsibilities. The responsibility for mission planning is shared jointly by all flight 
members and the operations and intelligence functions of fighter organizations. Fighter unit 
personnel must accomplish sufficient flight planning to ensure safe mission execution, to include fuel requirements, map preparation, and takeoff/landing data.  (T-1). 
2.2. Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Programs. Bird Watch Conditions are 
defined in AFI 91- 202, The US Air Force Mishap Prevention Program , and AFI 91- 212, 
Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) Management Program . The OG/CC will  determine 
local BASH procedures.  (T-3). 
2.2.1. Takeoffs, landings, or low -levels within one hour of either sunrise or sunset during the 
phase II period increase likelihood of bird strike. Significant bird hazards are published in flight information publications (FLIP) general planning GP, the IFR Supplement and local 
airfield  guidance.  
2.2.2. When operating at airfields where no BASH program exists, pilots should make 
decisions  based  on observable  bird conditions  and seek assistance from  local  airfield  personnel.  
2.2.3. Pilots  should consider bird migratory patterns during enroute portion of the mission to 
minimize  the potential  of an in-flight  bird strike.  The Bird Avoidance  Model  (BAM)  on United 
States Avian Hazard Advisory System ( http://www.usahas.com ) provides BASH 
information, including regionalized CONUS bird migration, portable flight planning software (PFPS) overlay, and latest news. See AFI 91- 212 for additional  information. 
2.3. Standards. The OG/CC may publish and approve group or wing standards. Operations Group 
Standardization and Evaluation (OGV) will review all standards for AFI 11 -series compliance 
prior to publication. (T-1). 
2.4. Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and   High   Yield   Explosive (CBRNE). 
Potential adversary use of CBRNE weapons against a friendly airfield presents a serious threat to 
flying operations. Although the most effective way for aircrews to avoid this threat is to be airborne before those weapons are detonated/dispersed and then land at a f ield that has not been 
contaminated, all personnel must be prepared to operate from a field that has come under CBRNE attack.  (T-1). 
2.4.1. Mission Preparation. Be aware of the status of the CBRNE environment at the planned 
launch and recovery  airfields,  potentia l divert  bases,  and throughout  the area in which  the sortie 
may fly. Know the current and forecast surface wind direction and the MOPP level in effect for relevant sectors of the airfield. Don appropriate aircrew chemical defense equipment (ACBRN) or Groun d Crew Ensemble (GCE) to match the appropriate MOPP level (reference 
AFTTP 3 -4, Airman’s Manual , and carry individual protective equipment (IPE) as required. 
(T-1). 
2.4.2. Stepping to Fly and Aircraft Preflight.  This may entail  donning ACBRN or transitioning 
from  GCE to ACBRN. Take precautions to protect aircrew from injury and or  contamination 
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  9  
while in transit from the squadron facility to the aircraft. (T -1). If possible, transport aircrew 
in a vehicle that provides overhead cover (enclosed vehicl e). If aircrew travel on foot is 
unavoidable, choose a route that takes maximum advantage of available overhead cover (sun 
shades, buildings, etc.) to avoid agents that may be settling from the air. If extra aircrew 
members are available for preflight duti es, consider assigning them to do so wearing GCE. 
This will allow the aircrew actually flying to minimize exposure. If Alarm Red occurs during 
the step or preflight process, take cover and don appropriate MOPP. (T -1). This may require 
use of the ground crew  mask.  A hardened aircraft  shelter  (HAS)  provides  optimum  protection, 
if available.  Use caution if entering  a HAS  that contains  aircraft  and/or  equipment. Close  doors 
after entry. If a HAS or other overhead cover is not immediately available, accept the best rapidly reachable  cover.  
2.4.3. Engine Start to Takeoff. If a HAS is available, use it to minimize exposure time by 
accomplishing aircraft arming and End of Runway (EOR) procedures inside it (if local procedures permit) and by delaying taxi time as long as possible prior to  takeoff.  
2.4.3.1.  Aircraft Launch to Survive (LTS). Units will develop local procedures to  provide 
this option to the commander. (T -1). In general, aircraft may LTS any time after engine 
start if they have sufficient fuel and safe, expeditious acce ss to a runway. This option may 
only be practical for aircraft that are near EOR prior to takeoff or that have just landed. 
2.4.3.2.  Alarm Red Prior to Taxi. If in a HAS, the normal procedure is to shut down. 
Engine  noise  may preclude  effectiveness of normal  alert notification  procedures,  so ensure 
ground personnel are aware of the alarm warning, assume proper MOPP, and close HAS doors. Use hand signals if necessary.  
2.4.3.3.  Alarm Red (or Theater Equivalent) After Taxi. Units typically establish 
procedures for this continge ncy depending on whether additional protection is available 
along the taxi route (empty HAS, for instance). Ideally, ground crew sheltering in such a HAS  would be available to assist  in normal  engine  shutdown procedures  and to close  HAS 
doors. If protection is not available, the best option may be LTS. Maintain contact with Command and Control (C2) entities (Wing Operations Center, Maintenance Operations Center, Supervisor of Flying, etc.) to ensure unity of effort in the overall plan. (T-1). 
2.4.4. Takeoff to Landing.  
2.4.4.1.  Contamination. If Chemical Warfare (CW) agent contamination occurred prior  to 
takeoff, flying the aircraft will dissipate the agent to some degree. The total amount of dissipation will be greater with lower flight altitudes and longer flight times. Because the agent  may have  entered  wheel  wells,  flaps,  etc., consider  flying  in landing configuration to 
increase airflow to these areas. In any circumstances, merely flying the aircraft is unlikely to achieve complete decontamination. 
2.4.4.2.  Preparing to Land. Aircrew should remain aware of the status of primary and 
alternate landing locations. Do not attempt to land during Alarm Red situations unless there is no other option. Follow C2 directions and either hold or divert. If mission needs preclude divert , hold until the Alarm Red (or theater equivalent) has cleared or become  an Alarm 
Black. Prior to landing, gain awareness of contaminated sectors of the airfield and of current/forecast surface winds. Use this information in conjunction with C2 direction t o 
plan a route from landing to engine shutdown. The liquid deposition phase following a 
10 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
CW airburst attack can extend up to 1 hour. If landing during Alarm Black, expect a 
contaminated environment and MOPP 4. 
2.4.5. Landing to Engine Shutdown. Ta ke advantage of any protection available, minimizing 
taxi time and distance. Maintain contact with C2 in order to remain aware of unexploded ordnance and/or damage to airfield movement surfaces. (T -1). If a HAS is available and local 
procedures permit, accomplish aircraft de -arm and EOR procedures there. If Alarm Red (or 
Theater Equivalent) occurs between landing and engine shutdown, considerations are similar to those discussed in the engine -start-to-takeoff section.  
2.4.6. After Engine Shutdown. Don appropriate MOPP if not already worn. (T -1). If 
circumstances permit, accomplish normal post -flight inspection procedures. If the aircraft is 
not contaminated, close the canopy. If there is any suspicion of personnel contamination, aircrew will process through an airc rew contamination control area (ACCA). (T -1). 
Accomplish maintenance debriefings under cover to the maximum extent  possible.  
2.5. Flight Material Preparation.  
2.5.1. Mission Data Card (MDC). The minimum takeoff and landing data (TOLD) 
requirements on the MDC are: 2,000 foot acceleration check speed (if computed takeoff roll exceeds 2,500 feet); refusal speed (dry/wet); rotation speed; takeoff speed; takeoff distance; 
normal  landing speed  and distance (dry/wet); heavyweight  (immediately  after takeoff)  landing 
speed and distance (dry/wet). If computed takeoff roll is less than 2,500 feet, pilots must 
evaluate aircraft performance by comparing actual takeoff distance to computed takeoff distance or use a 1000 foot acceleration check speed.  (T-1). 
2.5.2. Local Area Maps. Pilots mu st carry a local area map unless pilot aids include jettison 
areas,  divert  information, controlled  bailout  areas,  and provide  sufficient  detail  of the local  area 
to remain within assigned training areas.  (T-1). 
2.5.3. Enroute Charts. Pilots may substitute FLIP enroute charts for maps on navigational 
flights within areas adequately covered by these charts.  
2.5.4. Low Altitude Maps.  
2.5.4.1.  On low altitude flights, each pilot will carry a current map (updated using Chart 
Update Manual or electronic equivalent) of the route/operating area. (T -1). Pilots will 
ensure it is of such scale and quality that the detail of terrain features, hazards, and chart annotations permits navigation and safe mission accomplishment. (T -1). Pilots will 
circle/highlight manmade  obstacles at above  planned flight  altitude  within  5 nautical  miles 
(NM) of the planned route. (T -1). Pilots will annotate time or distance tick marks and 
headings. (T-1). 
2.5.4.2.  Pilots will annotate route abort altitude (RAA) using the instrument flight rules 
(IFR) Off Airways guidance in AFI 11 -202V3, para 6.2.2.2. (T-1). 
2.5.4.3.  For flights inside the CONUS under visual flight rules (VFR) or inside Milita ry 
Training Routes (MTR), pilots will comply with the  following:  
2.5.4.3.1.  Use FLIP AP/1B  and either  sectional  aeronautical  charts  or mission  planning 
software (e.g., Falcon View/JMPS). (T -1). Pilots will select the following overlay 
options for PFPS/Falcon View: airports/heliports, airspace boundaries, airways,  MTR, 
parachute jump and special use airspace boundaries. (T -1). 
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  11  
2.5.4.3.2.  Annotate low level charts, or locally developed low -level route books, with 
location and dimensions of class B/C/D airspace, military airfields, civil airfields, and 
other potential high density traffic areas (e.g., parachute activity areas and ultra - 
light/hang glider/glider sites) within 5 NM of any planned VFR route or MTR lateral 
boundary. (T-1). Pilots will annotate airfield approach control frequencies in the 
vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as well as the intersection of other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict.  (T-1). 
2.5.4.4.  Outside the continental United States (CONUS), pilots will follow gaining 
MAJCOM, theater, or host n ation guidance on mission planning. (T -1). If no such guidance 
exists, pilots will use the best charts or flight planning software overlay options available to accomplish the intent of maximizing traffic awareness and awareness of controlled airspace boundaries.  (T-1). 
2.5.5. Digital Terrain System (DTS) and Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System 
(AGCAS). F -16 mission planners will ensure re -gridded digital terrain elevation data 
(RDTED) coverage is adequate for the mission area and is loaded to each flight m ember’s 
advanced data transfer cartridge ADTC to ensure maximum AGCAS protection. (T -1). 
Without appropriate RDTED coverage, or when corrupted data is present, AGCAS still 
provides recovery protection to 50 feet MSL, however this may not prevent potential ground 
collision when MSL elevation is  higher.  
2.5.6. All qualified crewmembers will carry current and applicable checklists and pilot aids 
on every flight. (T-1). 
2.6. Fuel Conservation. Pilots will manage aviation fuel as a limited commodity and precious 
resource; design procedures for optimal fuel use and efficiencies throughout all phases of  mission 
execution, to include ground operations, flight plans, power settings and climb/descent profiles. (T-1). Incorporate enroute tasks to make maximum use of airborne lear ning opportunities.  
2.7. Overwater.  Flight  members  must  accomplish  planned flights  over water,  outside  of the local 
training area (e.g., deployments, cross countries, programmed delivery for maintenance (PDM) inputs, etc.) as a two -ship minimum. (T -2). The OG/CC must approve all single ship over water 
flights that are outside of the local training area. (T -3). For deployments under ACC/AOS 
movement control, AFI 11- 207, Fighter Aircraft Delivery, waiver authorities  apply.  
2.8. Briefing and  Debriefing.  
2.8.1. All flig ht members will attend the briefing unless previously coordinated with 
unit/squadron supervisors. (T -3). Flight leads are responsible for presenting a logical briefing 
to promote a safe and effective mission. Structure flight briefings to accommodate the capabilities of each pilot in the flight. Any item published in combat air force 
(CAF)/wing/group/squadron standards or AFI/AFMANs and understood by all participants may be briefed as "standard."  
2.8.2. Flight leads must plan adequate time to discuss required brie fing items depending on 
complexity of the mission and pilot capabilities, and start flight briefings at least 1.5 hours before scheduled takeoff. (T -1). Flight leads will start alert briefings in sufficient time to be 
completed prior to pilot changeover. (T-1). Items may be briefed in any sequence, provided all 
minimum requirements listed in this manual and AFI 11 -202V3, para 4.19 are addressed. (T -
0). Additional time and cockpit/crew resource management emphasis is necessary in  D- 
12 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
model sorties especially on familiarization and incentive flights. The passenger must 
demonstrate  oxygen regulator use, ability  to establish  multiple  airways and mask  removal  after 
being strapped in. (T-1). Reference Attachment 2 for example briefing guides. Flight leads 
will include the following for all flight briefings:  
2.8.2.1.  Weather and notices to airmen (NOTAMs).  (T-2). 
2.8.2.2.  Emergency procedures . (T-2). 
2.8.2.3.  Mission priorities and task management.  (T-2). 
2.8.2.4.  Significant rules (e.g., SPINS, Training Rules, ROE). (T-2). 
2.8.2.5.  Flight member responsibilities and deconfliction contracts. Flight leads will brief 
a formation deconfliction/blind/get well plan for every phase of flight. (T-2). 
2.8.3. Flight leads will emphasize the following for all low -level  briefings: 
2.8.3.1.  Obstacle/terrain acquisition and avoidance, bird hazards, emergency actions and 
weather avoidance with route abort procedures.  (T-2). 
2.8.3.2.  Employment of all Collision Avoidance Advisories and Digital Terrain System 
warnings to include AGCAS. (T-2). 
2.8.3.3.  Human factors to include task prioritization, G -excess illusion, and perceptual 
issues associated with flight over water/featureless terrain.  (T-2). 
2.8.3.4.  Airfield approach control frequencies in the vicinity of class B/C/D airspace as 
well as the intersection of  other VR/IR routes or other areas of conflict.  (T-2). 
2.8.4. Dissimilar Formation Briefing. Flight leads must emphasize proper position to ensure 
wingtip clearance, flight member responsibilities, and aircraft- unique requirements for each 
phase of flight. (T-1). 
2.8.5. Alternate Mission/Events and Multiple Go Days. Flight leads  will: 
2.8.5.1.  Brief an alternate mission for each flight.  (T-1). 
2.8.5.1.1.  Ensure the alternate mission is less complex than the primary. (T -1). It 
should parallel the primary mission (e.g., Basic Fighter Maneuver s as alternate for  Air 
Combat Maneuvers, Basic Surface Attack for Surface Attack Tactics, and Tactical Intercepts for Defensive Counter  Air).  
2.8.5.1.2.  Brief  the specific mission  elements that are different,  if the alternate  mission 
does not parallel the planned mission. (T -1). 
2.8.5.1.3.  Ensure unbriefed missions/events are not flown. (T-1). 
2.8.5.1.4.  Mission elements may be modified and briefed airborne as long as flight 
safety is not compromised. Flight leads will ensure changes are acknowledge d by all 
flight members. (T -1). Continuation training (CT) missions may fly primary or 
alternate missions in any  sequence.  
2.8.5.2.  During deployed operations, exercises, or multiple -go days when aircraft turn 
times do not allow follow -on mission brief(s), if all f light members attend an initial flight 
brief, the flight lead need only brief any changes for subsequent  flights.  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  13  
2.8.5.3.  On multiple -go days, when subsequent missions are of equal or less complexity. 
Continuation training  (CT)  missions  may fly primary  or alternate  missions  in any sequence. 
Units will schedule and plan upgrade/evaluation events on the first sortie only. (T -3). If 
that sortie is non -effective for weather, maintenance or airspace, instructor pilots 
(IPs)/standardization  and evaluation flight  examiners (SEFEs)  may elect  to accomplish  the 
planned upgrade/evaluation events in the second sortie.  
2.8.6. Debriefing.  
2.8.6.1.  Flight  leads  will ensure  all missions  are debriefed  and address in-flight execution, 
flight member responsibilities, deconfliction contracts, tactical employment priorities,  and 
sensor management.  (T-1). 
2.8.6.2.  Flight  leads will review  the video/audio record  of all tactical  portions  of the sortie 
to assess flight members’ anti -G straining maneuver (AGSM) effectiveness. (T -1). It is 
imperative  to evaluate AGSMs  after pilots  have  had time to fatigue.  This is typically  when 
the AGSM breaks down and G -induced Loss of Consciousness (GLOC) occurs. Pilots with 
poor AGSM technique or low G -tolerance will be identified to the operations  offic er. (T-
1). The squadron commander has the option of directing refresher centrifuge training in 
accordance with AFMAN 11 -404, Fighter Aircrew Acceleration Training  Program. 
2.9. Unit Developed Checklists/Local Pilot Aids. Unit developed checklists used in lieu of flight  
manual  checklists must  contain all items,  verbatim  and in order, unless  specifically  addressed in the 
flight manual. (T -1). OGV will ensure pilot aids contain the following  items:  
2.9.1. Briefing guides (reference Attachm ent 2 for examples).  (T-1). 
2.9.2. Local radio channelization.  (T-1). 
2.9.3. Appropriate airfield diagrams, to include cable/net barrier information.  (T-1). 
2.9.4. Emergency information (impoundment procedures, emergency action checklists, no 
radio (NORDO) procedures, divert information, search and rescue procedures, etc.).  (T-1). 
2.9.5. Divert base cable and barrier information.  (T-1). 
2.9.6. Bailout and jettison areas.  (T-1). 
2.9.7. Cross -country procedures to include: command and control, engine documentation, 
Joint Oil Analysis Program (JOAP) samples, and aircraft servicing.  (T-1). 
2.9.8. Other information as desired such as: stereo flight plans, turn procedures, local  training 
areas, instrument preflight, and alert setup procedures. (T -3). 
 
Section 2B —Night (see also night sections of Chapter 3, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)  
 
2.10. Minimum Safe Altitude  (MSA).  Pilots  will compute  the MSA  for each leg of the intended 
route of flight in accordance with AFI 11 -214. (T-1). 
2.11. Night chart requirements. Pilots must comply with the minimum requirement of a Form 
70 or chart/map containing headings, RAAs, MSAs, and maximum/minimum route structure 
altitudes.  (T-1). 
14 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
2.12. Video/Audio Recording. Pilots will operate the Digital Video Audio Data Recorder 
(DVADR)/ Digital Video Recorder (DVR) to the maximum extent possible without negatively 
impacting mission accomplishment and debrief. (T-1). 
2.13. G-Suit Use. Pilots  will wear  anti-G garments  on all flights  regardless  of anticipated  Gs. (T- 
3).

NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES  
 
Section 3A —Ground Operations  
 
3.1. Preflight. Pilots must:  
3.1.1.  [B/D model aircraft] Place the stick control switch in the FWD position when the rear 
cockpit is occupied by other than a fully qualified F -16 pilot. (T-1). 
3.1.2.  Not carry  baggage/equipment  in an unoccupied rear cockpit;  in the avionics  bay behind 
the cockpit; or in the aft canopy fixed transparency area (turtle back).  (T-1). 
3.1.3.  Not place objects in or on top of the engine intake. (T-1). 
3.1.4.  Secure publications, maps and personal items to avoid flight control/ throttle 
interference.  (T-1). 
3.1.5.  Select Pressure Breathing (PBG) except when using Aircrew Eye and Respiratory 
Protection System (AERPS) or Aircrew Chemical Biological, Radiological, Nuclear 
(ACBRN) equipment  (T-1). 
3.1.6.  Remove the port plug on the CRU -94/120 (if installed), if flying with the COMBAT 
EDGE  vest, and stow  the plug during flight  to prevent  a foreign  object  damage  (FOD)  hazard, 
then re -install upon completion of the sortie. (T-1). 
3.1.7.  Ensure ejection seat survival kit deployment switch is in the automatic position.  (T-1). 
3.1.8.  Not select CAT I on the Stores Configuration Switch with Category III configurations 
in accordance with T.O. 1F -16-1-2. (T-1). The Automated Stores Configuration System 
(ASCS),  https://awbs.hill.af.mil , may be used to find the desired loading and stores 
limitations; the published 1F -16( ) -1-2/1-3/1-4 takes precedence over any  discrepancies.  
3.2. Ground Visual Signals. Normally, pilot and ground crew communicate by the intercom 
system during all start- engine, pre -taxi and end of runway (EOR) checks. Pilots and ground crew 
must use the intercom system to the maximum extent possible anytime maintenance technicians are performing "redballs" on the aircraft and for emergency power unit (EPU) checks performed in congested ar eas. (T -1). Pilots will not actuate any system which endangers ground crew prior to 
receiving acknowledgment. (T -1). Units with an active air defense commitment may waive  use of 
ground intercom during alert scrambles. When ground intercom is not used, pilots and ground crew will use visual signals in accordance with AFMAN 11 -218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on 
the Ground, and this volume. (T -1). The crew chief will repeat the given signal when  it is safe to 
operate  the system.  (T-1). Pilots  and ground crew  must  use the following signals that augment AFI 
11-218. (T-1). 
3.2.1.  EPU OPERATIONAL CHECK. Raise two fingers and rotate  hand. 
3.2.2.  FLIGHT CONTROLS CLEAR. Raise arm, clench fist, and make a stirring  motion. 
3.2.3.  BRAKE CHECK. Hold left or right arm horizontal, open ha nd and push forward, 
breaking at the wrist (as in applying rudder pedal pressure with feet).  
3.2.4.  LOSS OF BRAKES WHILE TAXIING. Lower  tailhook.  
16 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
3.2.5.  GUN ARMAMENT CHECK. Point index finger forward with thumb upward 
simulating a pistol and shake head (yes or  no). 
3.2.6.  EPU ACTIVATION. Raise hand with palm open and perform shoving motion 
indicating "stay away." Then cup hands over oxygen mask indicating hydrazine vapors may 
be present.  
3.3. Taxi and  Arming.  
3.3.1.  Taxi Interval/Speed. Minimum taxi interval is 150 feet staggered or 300 feet in trail. 
Spacing may be reduced when holding short of or entering the runway. Unless mission requirements dictate, pilots will limit taxi speed to 30 knots, 15 knots over a raised cable, and 10 knots in turns. (T-1). 
3.3.2.  Ice/Snow Conditi ons. Pilots will not taxi during ice and/or snow conditions until all 
portions of the taxi route and runway have been checked for safe conditions. (T -1). When ice 
and/or snow are present on the taxiway, pilots will taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet spacing. (T -1). Minimum RCR for taxi is 10. (T -3). 
3.3.3.  Ice FOD Procedures. The following procedures apply when the conditions in T.O. 1F- 
16-1 indicate engine damage due to icing is  possible.  
3.3.3.1.  If conditions warrant, the Supervisor of Flying (SOF)/Top 3 will have the first 
flight lead start 5 minutes early to check for inlet ice formation.  (T-3). 
3.3.3.2.  Pilots must position ANTI ICE switch to ON prior to engine start.  (T-1). 
3.3.3.3.  An ice FOD monitor must be available to monitor the engine inlet for ice  buildup 
whenever the aircraft is stopped for an extended period of time (i.e., ramp/shelter and EOR). (T -1). Avoid standing water and snow/slush accumulations.  
3.3.3.4.  Pilots  must  hold in the arming  spot with an ice FOD monitor  present  until cleared 
for take -off. (T-1). 
3.3.3.5.  Pilots must shutdown immediately if icing is visually detected and notify the 
SOF/Top 3. (T-1). Make an appropriate entry in the aircraft forms and qualified  personnel 
must accomplish an intake inspection prior to restarting the engine. (T-1). 
3.3.4.  EPU  Check.  Pilots  will not allow  maintenance technicians  to approach the aircraft  until 
the EPU  check  is complete.  (T-1). Pilots  must  use intercom  or a "thumbs  up" signal  to indicate 
when safe.  (T-1). 
3.4. EOR Inspections and Before Takeoff Checks. Pilots will place  hands in view of ground 
personnel while the quick check inspection and/or arming/de -arming are in progress. (T -1). If the 
intercom  system  is not used during EOR checks,  the pilot will establish  and maintain  visual  contact 
with the chief and use visual signals. (T -1). Pilots must ensure EOR inspections are  accomplished 
immediately prior to takeoff at a designated location, usually near the end of the runway or while departing the chock area (not required for alert scrambles). (T -1). At non- USAF bases, pilot s will 
make every attempt to coordinate an EOR inspection with the host maintenance unit. (T-1). 
3.4.1.  Forward Firing Ordnance. Pilots will not taxi in front of aircraft being  armed/de -armed 
with forward firing ordnance. (T-3). 
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  17  
3.4.2.  Flight members will inspect each other for proper configuration and any abnormalities. 
(T-3). 
3.5. Flight Lineup. Consider weather conditions, runway conditions, and runway width. Pilots 
must comply with minimum spacing between separated elements/flights of 500 feet. (T -1). 
Wingmen  must  maintain  wingtip  clearance with their element  lead.  (T-1). If runway width  permits, 
pilots will lineup with wingtip clearance between all aircraft in the flight.  (T-1). 
 
Section 3B —Takeoff and Departure  
 
3.6. Takeoff. Pilots  will: 
3.6.1.  Not takeoff when the RCR is less than 10. (T -1). If reporting “slush on runway”, 
consider the RCR is 12 unless otherwise reported and takeoffs are authorized. 
3.6.2.  Review takeoff data with emphasis on takeoff and abort factors such as short/wet 
runway, heavy gross weights, and cable configurations. (T-1). 
3.6.3.  On training missions, not takeoff if the computed takeoff roll exceeds 80 percent of  the 
available runway. (T-1). 
3.6.4.  Ensure a compatible departure end cable is raised for all takeoffs and landings 
(including rem otely operated cables).  (T-3). 
3.6.5.  Get OG/CC approval for intersection takeoffs if operational requirements  dictate.  
3.6.6.  Make an afterburner takeoff anytime the computed MIL power takeoff roll exceeds 50 
percent of the available runway.  (T-1). 
3.6.7.  Centerline Stores: s tart the takeoff roll beyond a raised approach end cable unless 
runway length, runway conditions (wet/icy), winds, gross weight or cable availability dictate 
otherwise. (T-3). Exception: aircraft with a centerline fuel tank or a centerline mounted 
AN/ALQ- 188 pod may takeoff  across approach end BAK- 12 arrestment cables with an 8-point 
tie down system.  
3.6.8.  Comply with minimum takeoff interval between aircraft/elements of 10 seconds (15 
seconds for afterburner). (T -1). Pilots will increase interval to 20 seconds minimum for  join- 
up on top or when carrying live air -to-surface ordnance (excluding BDU -33s, rockets, and 
20mm ammunition). (T -1). 
3.6.9.  Steer the aircraft toward the center of the runway after releasing brakes.  (T-1). 
3.7. Initial Join -up and Rejoins. Aircraft/elements  will: 
3.7.1.  Comply with the minimums of 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 statute miles (5 km) visibility 
for VFR join -ups below a ceiling. (T-1). 
3.7.2.  Maintain  350 knots  calibrated  air speed  (KCAS)  while  climbing or 300 KCAS  at cruise 
until join -up is accom plished unless mission requirements necessitate a different  airspeed. (T- 
3). Pilots may delay AB cancellation to establish closure on lead or lead element. OG/CCs may 
approve different climb and cruise airspeeds within dash one  limits.  
3.7.3.  Accomplish battle d amage (BD) check on return to base (RTB) when practical (i.e., 
weather  prohibits  accomplishing BD check).  (T-2). Aircraft/elements  are required  to complete 
this check after expending any ordnance (including 20mm ammunition).  (T-3). 
18 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
3.7.4.  Accomplish air -to-air systems checks above 10,000 feet MSL when practical. (T -1). 
3.7.5.  For further join -up procedures, see Night Operational Procedures ( Section 3E ) and 
Instrument Procedures ( Chapter  4). 
 
Section 3C —Enroute  
 
3.8. Air Refueling.  
3.8.1.  Pilots undergoing initial or re -currency training in air refueling will not refuel with a 
student  boom  operator. (T-1). Lead/IP  will announce  when  an upgrade  or re-qualification  pilot 
is in the formation and request  a qualified (non -student) boomer. (T-1). 
3.8.2.  Pilots will inform boom operator when refueling from particular tanker type (e.g., KC - 
10, KC -135, or KC -46) for the first time.  (T-1). 
3.8.3.  Quick flow procedures are authorized and pilots will conduct them in accordance with 
(IAW) ATP -56B and AFTTP 3 -3.F-16, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals --F-16. (T-1). 
3.9. Aircraft Handling Characteristics (AHC) and Automated Recovery Training Series 
(ARTS)/Maneuvering  Parameters.  
3.9.1.  Pilots  will comply  with the following minimum  altitudes  for the prescribed  maneuvers:  
3.9.1.1.  Confidence Maneuvers/Advanced Handling -  10,000 feet above ground level 
(AGL), except dive recovery maneuver (15,000 feet AGL minimum entry altitude). (T-1). 
3.9.1.2.  Horn Awareness and Recovery Training series (HARTS) number s 1, 2 and 3 - 
10,000 feet AGL. (T-1). 
3.9.1.3.  HARTS series numbers 4 and 5 -  15,000 feet AGL. (T-1). 
3.9.1.4.  Not descend below 5,000 feet AGL during aerobatic maneuvering. (T-1). 
3.9.1.5.  HARTS 3 with pilot activated recovery system (PARS) –  10,000 feet AGL. (T - 
1). 
3.9.1.6. ARTS  2 – 8,000 feet AGL. (T-1). 
3.9.1.7. ARTS series number 1, 3, 4, and 5 – 5,000 feet AGL. (T -1). 
3.9.2.  Pilots must avoid flight through wingtip vortices/jet wash. (T -1). If unavoidable, the 
aircraft should be unloaded immediately to approximately 1  G. 
3.9.3.  Pilots will not manually extend the trailing edge flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft 
performance. (T-1). EXCEPTION: Trailing edge flaps may be manually extended during 
intercepts performed by airspace control alert tasked unit aircraft, or during low/slow (below 
5,000 feet AGL) visual identification (VID) training, on targets traveling at less than 200 KCAS.  
3.9.4.  Pilots will not attempt to bypass flight control limiters to improve performance. (T -1). 
Examples are: transfer fuel to alter center of gravity (C G), manual pitch override (MPO) to 
gain additional negative G or assaulting two limiters at low  airspeed.  
3.9.5.  The minimum airspeed for all maneuvering is based upon activation of the low speed 
warning tone.  Except  when  operating  IAW  a MAJCOM -approved syllabus  (e.g., air force  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  19  
materiel command (AFMC) high angle of attack training), the pilot will take action to correct 
the low speed condition when the low speed warning tone sounds. (T -1). 
3.9.6.  The following is guidance  for Horn  Awareness and Recovery  Training  Series  (HARTS) 
(reference AFTTP  3-3.F-16): 
3.9.6.1.  Pilots will fly HARTS maneuvers in category (CAT) -1 loaded aircraft only. (T - 
1). 
3.9.6.2.  In F-16 C/D Block 40- 52 aircraft, pilots will not fly HARTS maneuvers 4 and 5 
unless in one of the following configurations: Clean (no tanks), or 300 gallon centerline tank. MAU -12s may be carried on stations 3 and 7, and/or AIM -9/AMDs/ACMI/CATM - 
120s may be carried on stations 1, 2, 8 and/or 9. Pilots must ensure CATM -120s are 
symmetrically loaded if carried. (T -1). AIM -9/AMD/ACMI can be symmetric or one 
missile asymmetric.  Inlet mounted target pod TGP and/or harm target system (HTS) pods 
may be  carried.  
3.9.6.3.  For all F-16 Blocks, external tanks should be dry to avoid a faster than expected 
airspeed bleed -off due to excessive weight during the pull up, for all HARTS  maneuvers.  
3.9.7.  The following is guidance for Automated Recovery Training Series (ARTS) for PARS 
recovery profiles (reference AFTTP3 -3.F-16): 
3.9.7.1.  With exception of the HARTS 3 with PARS maneuver, PARS demo maneuvers 
may be flown in any aircraft configuration unless concern for over -G exists. However, a 
CAT  I loading is preferred  to demonstrate  the full maneuvering potential  of the automated 
recovery system. The potential for over -G exists if any Nose -low PARS maneuver is 
performed when  the aircraft  configuration has a symmetric  G-limit of less than 6.2 G CAT 
I or 5.2 G CAT  III. 
3.9.7.2.  Pilots will not demonstrate AGCAS recoveries by executing dive maneuvers 
toward the ground. (T-1). AGCAS is designed to provide a minimal buffer above the 
ground during recovery and pilots must not intentionally activate it. (T-1). 
3.10. Formation, General. Flight leads and instructors will ensure contracts, roles and 
responsibilities of each flight member are established, briefed, executed and debriefed. (T -1). 
Flight members will immediately notify lead if unable to fulfill basic responsibilities, contracts  or 
other assigned tasks. (T -1). Flight leads will avoid tasking element leads/wingmen beyond their 
abilities without sacrificing basic responsibilities. (T -1). Reference AFTTP 3 -3.F-16 and AFTTP 
3-1.F-16, Tactical  Employment --F-16. 
3.10.1.  The flight lead is always responsible for flight actions. Wingmen will be prepared to 
take the lead when directed. (T -1). 
3.10.2.  In instrument  meteorological  conditions  (IMC),  pilots  will comply  with the maximum 
flight size in visual formation of four aircraft except when flying in close f ormation with a 
tanker. (T-1). 
3.10.3.  Pilots will not use rolling maneuvers to maintain or regain formation position below 
5,000 feet AGL or in airspace where aerobatics are prohibited. (T-1). 
3.10.4.  Pilots must use airborne visual signals in accordance with AFPAM 11 -205, Aircrew 
Quick Reference To Aircraft Cockpit And Formation Flight Signals , or detailed in local  
20 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
procedures. (T-1). Pilots must initiate configuration changes for four -ship flights by radio call, 
when practical. (T-1). When formation position changes are directed by radio, all wingmen 
will acknowledge prior to initiating the change. (T -1). Pilots must make a radio call when 
directing position changes at night or under instrument conditions. (T -1). 
3.10.5.  Flight leads will not break up flights from visual or sensor formations until each pilot 
has a fix from which to navigate (visual, radar, inertial navigation system (INS) or ta ctical air 
navigation (TACAN) system). (T-1). 
3.10.6.  Lead changes. Pilots  will: 
3.10.6.1.  Comply  with the minimum altitude  for changing leads within  a formation of 500 
feet AGL over land or 1,000 feet AGL over water [see also Night Operational Procedures 
(Section 3E )]. (T-1). 
3.10.6.2.  Initiate lead changes from a stabilized, wings level attitude during limited 
visibility conditions (e.g., night, IMC). (T -1). See also Night Operational Procedures 
(Section 3E ) and Instrument Procedures ( Chapter 4 ). (T-1). 
3.10.6.3.  Not initiate  lead changes  with the wingman  further  back  than normal  fingertip  or 
route position, or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast. (T -1). 
3.11. G-Awareness Exercises (G- Ex) (Reference AFTTP 3 -3.F-16 and AFI  11-214).  
3.11.1.  Pilots must accomplish a G -Ex if planned maneuvering exceeds 5G. (T -1). Pilots  will 
accomplish the G -Ex day or night, only in visual meteorological conditions (VMC), with a 
discernible horizon, and only whe n unaided or NVG -aided visual cues are adequate to safely 
perform  the maneuver. (T-1). If these  requirements  are not met, pilots  must  omit the G-Ex and 
reduce mission tasking to limit maneuvering to 5G. (T-1). 
3.11.2.  Unless performing a syllabus required event (e.g., chase of a G -Ex), flight members 
will follow AFTTP 3 -3.F-16 G -Awareness Exercise Procedures. (T -1). Pilots use on -board 
systems (e.g., air -to-air TACAN, Radar, data link) to establish separation prior to m aneuver 
execution. (T-1). 
3.11.3.  Pilots must conduct the G -Ex in order of preference listed below to help ensure the 
airspace is clear  from potential  traffic  conflicts.  (T-1). If practical,  use air traffic  control  (ATC) 
to help clear the  airspace:  
3.11.3.1.  Special Use Airspace (e.g., Restricted/Warning areas, Air Traffic Control 
Assigned Airspace (ATCAA), memorandum of understanding (MOA)s and MAJCOM approved large scale exercise/special mission  areas).  
3.11.3.2.  In VFR only above 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use  airspace.  
3.11.3.3.  In VFR only inside the confines of a Military Training Route  (MTR).  
3.11.3.4.  In VFR only below 10,000 feet MSL outside of special use  airspace.  
3.11.4.  Flight/element leads flying outside of CONUS will follow gaining MAJCOM,  theater 
or host nation guidance on airspace in w hich G -Ex may be performed. (T-1). If no such 
guidance exists, follow the above procedures to the maximum practical  extent.  
3.12. Tactical  Formations.  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  21  
3.12.1.  Tactical Maneuvering. Wingmen/elements must maneuver relative to the flight 
lead/lead element and maintain sight. (T -1). Trailing aircraft/elements are responsible for 
deconfliction with lead aircraft/elements and will do so vertically when required. (T -1). At low 
altitude, wingmen/trailing elements will deconflict high. (T -1). Trailing aircraft/element(s) 
will maintain sufficient spacing so that primary emphasis during formation maneuvering/turns 
is on low altitude awareness and deconfliction within elements, not on deconfliction between 
elements. (T-1). Normally, the wingman is responsi ble for flight path deconfliction, but the 
flight/element lead will be primarily responsible when: (T-1). 
3.12.1.1.  Tactical maneuvering places the leader well aft of the wingman’s 3/9 line or 
forces the wingman’s primary attention away from the leader (e.g., wingma n becomes 
engaged fighter).  
3.12.1.2.  The wingman calls  "padlocked."  
3.12.1.3.  The wingman calls “blind.” Primary deconfliction responsibility transfers back 
to the wingman once the wingman acknowledges a visual on his  lead.  
3.12.2.  Loss of Visual (“Blind”)  Procedures.  
3.12.2.1.  Flight  members  will call blind with an altitude  to the hundreds  of feet, i.e., “Blind 
16.9.” (T -1). The visual flight member will respond with “visual” and talk eyes on. (T-1). 
3.12.2.2.  If the other flight member is also “Blind,” they will call blind with an altitude. 
(T-1). Lead will be directive to ensure altitude separation is maintained and direct the 
wingman’s flow direction. (T -1). Use a minimum of 500 feet (1,000 feet above 5,000 feet 
AGL) altitude separation. Avoid climbs/descents through the deconfliction altitude. All flight members must visually clear their flight path.  (T-1). 
3.12.2.3.  If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind 16.9" call, then the 
flight  member/element  initiating  the call will maneuver  away  from the last known position 
of the other  flight  memb er/element  and climb/descend  if necessary.  (T-1). If visual  contact 
is still not regained, the flight lead will take additional positive action to ensure flight path 
deconfliction. (T-1). Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary 
blocks need to be  considered.  
3.12.3.  Sensor formations. If situational awareness (SA) is lost or “Blind” in a sensor 
formation, pilots must call “Blind” with altitude and follow the above procedures. (T -1). 
Wingmen will strive to maintain an altitude stack at all times in sensor formation.  (T-1). 
3.13. Chase  Formation.  
3.13.1.  Restrictions. Any pilot may fly safety chase for aircraft under emergency or impending 
emergency conditions. All chase events may be flown by IP/Flight Examiners (FEs)  or 
upgrading  IPs under  the supervisio n of an IP. Pilots  who have  successfully  completed an 
Instrument/Qualification evaluation may chase as safety observer for aircraft performing simulated instrument flight or hung ordnance patterns. Specialized missions (i.e., OT&E, Weapon System Evaluation Program (WSEP), live weapons delivery, etc.) and training 
conducted IAW AFMAN 11- 2F-16V1, F -16--Pilot Training, may be chased by Combat 
Mission Ready (CMR)/Basic Mission Capable (BMC) pilots designated by group/squadron commanders.  
3.13.2.  Procedures. (See AFTTP  3-3.F-16) 
22 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
3.13.2.1.  Chase aircraft can maneuver as necessary, but must maintain nose- tail 
separation. (T -1). The chase will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. 
(T-1). In the traffic pattern, the chase aircraft may maneuver as necessary to observe 
performance.  
3.13.2.2.  A safety observer in chase will maneuver in a 30 -60 degree cone with nose/tail 
clearance out to a range of 1,000 feet, from which he can effectively clear and/or provide 
assistance.  (T-3). 
3.13.2.3.  For live ordnance missions, the chase pilot must ensure fragmentation 
deconfliction for his aircraft. (T -1). 
3.14. Show Formation. Mission planners will refer to AFI 11 -209, Participation in Aerial Events , 
and applicable MAJCOM or ANG directives for specific rul es and appropriate approval levels to 
participate in static displays and aerial events. AGCAS SHOW mode may be selected only if operating IAW MAJCOM or ANG approved aerial  events.  
3.15. Low Altitude Operations (reference AFTTP 3 -1.F-16 and AFTTP 3-3.F-16). 
3.15.1.  Airsp eed and Altitude. Pilots will comply with the minimum airspeed for low level 
navigation of 300 KCAS  and the minimum  altitude  of 1,000 feet AGL  (or IAW  approved step- 
down training). (T -1). For night or IMC operation, pilots will comply with the minimum 
altitude of the MSA (see AFI 11- 214) unless operating under NVG LOWAT Procedures. (T - 
1). 
3.15.2.  At low altitude, pilots will immediately climb to a pre -briefed safe altitude  (minimum 
1,000 feet AGL) when experiencing task saturation, diverted attention, knock- it-off, or 
emergencies.  (T-1). 
3.15.2.1.  When a “PULL -UP-PULL -UP” warning sounds, the pilot will take immediate 
action to ensure terrain clearance, while referencing the primary flight instruments.  (T-1). 
3.15.2.2.  F-16s with pilot -selectable GCAS Minimum Terrain Clearance (MTC) settings 
will set an altitude that does not result in “PULL -UP” warnings at normal operational 
altitudes.  (T-1). Pilots  will comply with the minimum  MTC  of 50 feet for strafe  and visual 
bombing, and 25 percent of LOWAT Category minimum altitude for all other operations. (T-1). Wings with significant tall trees in the operating area or VR routes will account for 
average tree height when setting MTC altitudes. (T-1). 
3.15.2.3.  F-16s equipped with an operational  AGCAS  will ensure  NORM  mode  is selected 
prior to LOWAT operations down to 500 feet AGL to include HAS and LAS events. (T - 
1). If operations are necessary below 500 feet AGL, AGCAS MIN mode may be selected 
to prevent nuisance  fly-ups. 
3.15.3.  Weather. Consult FLIP for minimum weather on a VR or IR route. For low altitude 
training outside the CONUS, pilots will comply with theater/host nation guidance. (T -1). 
While on a VR Route in deteriorating weather, assess whether VMC can be maintained. If able 
to maintain VMC and it becomes apparent that weather ahead does not permit continued flight on the VR, pilots will maintain VMC, slow down, maneuver to exit the route structure, and establish a VFR hemispheric altitude. (T -0). If unable to maintain VMC pilots will climb to 
briefed deconfliction altitude s (reference Paragraph 2.8). (T -1). Squawk applicable  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  23  
(IFF/SIF) modes and codes and contact a controlling agency to pick up an IFR clearance if 
required. Maintain preplanned ground track.  
3.15.4.  Obstacle/Terrain Avo idance. If unable to visually acquire or ensure lateral  separation 
from known vertical obstructions which are a factor to the route of flight, flight leads will immediately direct a climb NLT 3 NM prior to the obstacle to an altitude that ensures vertical separation. (T-1). 
3.15.5.  At altitudes  below  1,000 feet AGL,  wingmen  will not fly at a lower  AGL  altitude  than 
lead.  (T-1). 
3.15.6.  When crossing high or hilly terrain, pilots will maintain positive G on the aircraft and 
do not exceed 120 degrees of bank. (T -1). Pilots will limit maneuvering at less than 1 G to 
upright bunting maneuvers. (T-1). 
 
Section 3D —Recovery and Landing  
 
3.16. Gear Checks. For a VFR straight in, pilots will call gear down no later than 3 NM final. (T -
1). For an instrument approach (reference Chapter 4 ), pilots will call gear down at the final 
approach fix or published glide slope intercept point. (T -1). For an overhead, call gear down 
departing the perch. For a SFO or FO, pilots will call gear down at base key. (T-1). 
3.17. Angle of Attack (AOA). Final approach normally is flown at 11 degrees AOA. Pilots will 
compare the computed final approach airspeed with AOA. (T -1). 
3.18. Landing restrictions.  When the computed landing roll exceeds 80 percent of the available 
runway, land at an alternate if possible. When  the RCR at the base of intended landing is less than 
10, land at an alternate if possible. Pilots will not land over any raised web barrier (e.g., MA -1A, 
61QS11). (T-1). 
3.19. Desired touchdown point and spacing.  
3.19.1.  The desired touchdow n point is 500 feet from the aim point. The aim point for a VFR 
approach is the threshold. The aim point  for a precision  approach  is the glide  path interception 
point. To avoid possible speedbrake or nozzle damage, pilots will touch down either past a raised approach -end cable, or 500 feet prior to the cable. (T -1). With centerline stores, 
touchdown is normally past an approach- end cable. Circumstances that may dictate landing 
prior to the cable include runway length, wind, runway condition (wet or icy), gross weight or 
an aircraft malfunction where full normal braking may not be available. A landing with centerline stores may be made across BAK -12 arr estment cables which have been modified 
with an 8- point -tie-down system.  
3.19.2.  Pilots will comply with a touchdown spacing behind an aircraft while flying a 13 
degree approach at a minimum of 6,000 feet due to susceptibility of the aircraft to wake turbulence and speedbrake/tail scrapes. (T -1). Pilots will comply with the minimum pattern 
and touchdown spacing between landing aircraft of 3,000 feet for similar aircraft (e.g., F -16 
following F -16), 6,000 feet for dissimilar fighter aircraft (e.g., F -16 following F -15) or as 
directed by MAJCOM or the landing base, whichever is higher. (T -1). When wake  turbulence 
is expected due to calm winds (less than or equal to 5 knots) or when landing with a light tail wind, pilots  will comply with increased  pattern/touchdown spacing to 6,000 feet minimum.  
24 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
(T-1). Under these conditions, moderate to severe wake turbulence has been reported out to 
7,000 foot touchdown spacing.  
3.19.3.  All aircraft will land in the center of the runway and clear to the cold side when 
speed/conditions  permit.  (T-1). After achieving  a safe taxi speed, pilots  will not delay  clearing 
to the cold side as this can create a conflict for subsequent landing aircraft. (T -1). Flight leads 
should brief which side of the runway is the cold side when operating at a strange  field.  
3.19.4.  When  an F-16 aircraft  is used to certify  a BAK- 12 interconnected with a BAK- 14 cable 
retraction system, the minimum engagement speed will be 75 knots groundspeed and the 
maximum engagement speed will be 90 knots groundspeed. Pilots should place the airspeed selection switch to GS for their crosscheck in the HUD during the certification. As the F -16 
engages a BAK -12/14 at a speed approaching and/or exceeding 100 knots, damage to the 
underside of the F -16 aircraft may result. Fo r actual emergencies, T.O. limits will  apply. 
3.20. Low Approaches.  
3.20.1.  Pilots will observe the following minimum altitudes: (T-1). 
3.20.1.1.  IP/FEs flying chase position: 50 feet  AGL.  
3.20.1.2.  Formation low approaches: 100 feet  AGL.  
3.20.1.3.  Chase aircraft during an emergency: 300 feet AGL unless safety or 
circumstances dictate otherwise.  
3.20.2.  During go- around, pilots will remain 500 feet below VFR overhead traffic pattern 
altitude until crossing the departure end of the runway unless local procedures, missed approach/climbout procedures or contr oller instructions dictate otherwise.  (T-1). 
3.21. Touch -and- Go Landings. Fly touch- and-go landings IAW AFI 11- 202V3. Pilots will not 
fly them with live or hung external ordnance or with fuel remaining in any external tank. (T-1). 
3.22. Overhead Traffic Patterns. Unle ss the OG/CC determines that local conditions (e.g., threat 
condition, populated areas) dictate otherwise, pilots will not fly overhead patterns with unexpended heavy- weight ordnance (larger than BDU -33). (T-3). 
3.23. Tactical  Overhead  Traffic  Patterns.  Pilots  will only execute  tactical  entry  to the overhead 
traffic pattern if the following conditions are met:  (T-1). 
3.23.1.  Published overhead pattern altitude and airspeed are used.  
3.23.2.  Specific procedures have been developed locally and coordinated with appropriate  air 
traffic control agencies.  
3.23.3.  The flight consists of a maximum of four aircraft (aircraft/elements more than 6,000 
feet in trail are considered a separate flight).  
3.23.4.  No aircraft offset from the runway in the direction of the break (the intent is to avoid 
requiring a tighter than normal turn to arrive on normal  downwind). 
3.23.5.  Normal downwind, base turn positions, and spacing are  flown. 
3.24. Closed Traffic Patterns. Pilots will initiate the pattern at the departure end of the runway 
unless  directed/cleared  otherwise by local  procedures  or the controlling  agency. (T-3). An element  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  25  
low approach may be followed by a sequential closed with controller approval. Plan to arrive on 
downwind at 200- 250 KCAS.  
3.25. Back Seat Approaches and  Landings.  
3.25.1.  An upgrading IP will only accomplish back seat landings when an IP is in the front 
cockpit. (T-1). 
3.25.2.  During back seat approaches and landings, the front seat pilot will visually clear the 
area, monitor aircraft parameters/configurations and be prepared to di rect a go -around or take 
control of the aircraft (as briefed by the rear cockpit IP) if necessary.  (T-1). 
3.26. Formation  Approaches.  
3.26.1.  Aircraft must be symmetrically loaded. (T -1). Consider symmetrical as those stores 
loadings  which  do not require  an abnormal  trim or control  application  to counter  a heavy wing 
or yaw during takeoff and acceleration to climb airspeed. The weather will be at or greater than 500 foot ceiling and 1.5 statute miles visibility (or a flight member's weather category, whichever is higher). This also applies to chased approaches.  
3.26.2.  Elements will be led by a qualified flight lead unless an IP or flight lead qualified 
squadron supervisor is in the element. (T -1). 
3.26.3.  Pilots will use a rate of descent similar to a precision approach. (T -1). Fly a  published 
precision instrument approach if one is available. (T -1). If not, pilots will fly a non- precision 
approach or VFR straight in and reference available lighting systems (e.g., VASI, PAPI) for descent angle. (T -1). 
3.26.4.  If the crosswind exceeds 5 k nots, lead will position the wingman on the upwind side. 
(T-1). 
3.26.5.  The wingman will maintain a minimum of 10 feet lateral wingtip spacing.  (T-1). 
 
Section 3E —Night (see also night sections of Chapter 2, Chapter 5 and Chapter 6)  
 
3.27. General Night  Procedures.  
3.27.1.  Nigh t Ground Operations. The anti -collision (strobe) light may be OFF and the 
position lights  STEADY  if they prove  to be a distraction.  Pilots  will comply with a taxi spacing 
minimum of 300 feet and taxi on the centerline. (T -1). Pilots will use the taxi light during all 
night taxiing. (T -1). Exception: When the light might interfere with the vision of the pilot of 
an aircraft landing or taking off, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared wit hout the taxi light.  (T-1). 
3.27.2.  Night Takeoff. Aircraft will maintain the anti -collision light ON and position lights 
FLASH for takeoffs, unless IMC is anticipated shortly after takeoff. (T -3). Following takeoff, 
each aircraft will climb on runway heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating turns, except where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.  (T-3). 
3.27.3.  Night Join -up. For night join- up underneath a ceiling, pilots will comply with the 
minimums of a 3,000 foot ceiling and 5 statute miles visibility. (T -1). After join -up, pilots must 
ensure: the anti -collision light is OFF and position lights are STEADY for  all except  the 
26 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
last aircraft, which keeps the anti -collision light ON and position lights FLASH unless 
otherwise directed by the flight lead. (T -3). 
3.27.4.  Position/Lead Changes. Unless operating with NVGs, pilots will not change lead or 
wing positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind. (T -1). Pilots will call such 
changes over the radio and initiate them from a stabilized, wings -level attitude whenever 
possible. (T-1). 
3.27.5.  Night Break -up. Prior to a night formation break- up, the flight l ead will confirm 
position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting. (T-1). Wingmen will 
acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids. (T-1). 
3.27.6.  Night Landing. Land from the most precise approach available.  
3.28. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) Procedures.  
3.28.1.  NVG Preflight.  NVGs  must  be preflight  tested  and adjusted/focused  for the individual 
pilot using (in order of preference) the Hoffman ANV -20/20 Tester, a unit eye lane, or 
equivalent. (T -1). Reference AFI 11 -301V1, Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE)  Program.  
3.28.2.  Cockpit Lighting. Pilots will fly with NVGs only in aircraft whose cockpit lighting 
MAJCOM designates as NVG compatible. (T-2). MAJCOMs will only make such a 
designation if all control and performance instruments are sufficiently illuminated  by the 
NVG- compatible lighting so as to make them immediately available to the pilot in the event 
they need to transition to  instruments.  
3.28.3.  Weather/Visibility/Illumination Levels/Minimum Altitudes/Discernable Horizon. 
Reference AFI 11 -214, AFTTP 3- 3.F-16, a nd AFI 11- 202V3. All pilots conducting NVG 
operations that include air -to-air/surface- to-air threat reactions or air- to-ground 
dynamic/diving deliveries  will conduct  a “30-Up and 30-Down”  horizon orientation  maneuver 
before conducting tactical maneuvering. (T-3). Pilots will accomplish this maneuver in VMC 
and above the MSA. (T -1). It should be completed after the G -awareness exercise. The purpose 
is to evaluate horizon conditions and practice an NVG horizon orientation and crosscheck. If 
airspace precludes the maneuver, pilots operating on NVGs will limit maneuvers to AFI11-
214 “Restricted Maneuvering” guidelines. (T-1). Pilots adhere to the following guidelines 
when conducting the 30- Up and 30- Down  maneuver:  
3.28.3.1.  In VMC conditions (with a discernible horizon), and with sufficient altitude 
(~3,000- 5,000 feet) in approved operating airspace, pilots will accelerate to 350 KCAS 
minimum and maintain a minimum spacing of 6,000 feet between aircraft throughout the maneuver. (T-3). The flight lead will announce, “Standby 30- UP, 30- Down” and 
communicate a reference heading prior to execution for flight deconfliction. (T -3). Flight 
members will verify correct spacing, heading, and entry parameters and will communicate 
“stand by”  if not ready. (T-3). 
3.28.3.2.  Flight  leads will command “30 Up,”  and all pilots  will execute  a military  power, 
3-4 G wings -level pull up to place the bore cross on the 30 degree pitch ladder. (T -3). Pilots 
will evaluate and orient themselves with the horizon in the forward quadrants, both above and below the horizon while maintaining intra -flight deconfliction contracts. (T -3). Take  
note of the physical  cranial  movement  required  to move  the NVG field of regard  back to  the 
horizon, as well as the condition of the horizon due to ambient  factors.  If at any time 
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  27  
the airspeed drops below 250 KCAS, weather is encountered, or symptoms of spatial 
disorientation are recognized, the pilot will i mmediately transition to primary flight 
instruments, call a “knock it off (with reason),” and conduct an IMC nose -high recovery. 
(T-3). 
3.28.3.3.  After approximately 5 seconds, or sooner if airspace or altitude restrictions 
require, the flight lead will command “roll left (or right),  30 down”. (T-3). All aircraft will 
roll inverted and accomplish the military power, 3 -4 G wings -level pull to place the bore 
cross at the 30 degree nose- low, then roll upright on the reference heading. (T -3). Once 
intra-flight deconfliction is assured,  pilots  will repeat  the horizon crosscheck  and visibility 
assessment while maintaining the 30 degree -nose low attitude.  (T-3). 
3.28.3.4.  If during any portion of the maneuver a flight member determines that the 
visibility or horizon referenc e is unsuitable for tactical maneuvering per AFI11 -214 
guidance, the flight lead will modify the training profile and either transition to non- NVG 
formations or NVG formation tactics limited to AFI11 -214 “Restricted Maneuvering” 
guidelines. (T-1). Pilots w ill continually modify profiles or airspace utilization  throughout 
the sortie  if conditions  change  and no longer  permit the planned  maneuvering. (T-1). Flight 
training  modification  includes:  restricted  maneuvering limitations  (with  or without  NVGs) 
per AFI-11-214, a non- NVG formation IMC game plan, or accomplishing a briefed 
alternate mission without NVGs.  
3.28.3.5.  Pilots will continually cross -check visually perceived attitude aided by NVGs 
with frequent cross -checks of primary flight instruments throughout the mission. (T-1). 
3.28.4.  NVG Qualifications. Pilots will not wear NVGs in flight unless they are NVG qualified 
or a qualified NVG IP is in the flight (ratio of one NVG IP per non -NVG qualified pilot). (T -
1). F-16B/D Familiarization flights are authorized but the un it must ensure appropriate 
academics are accomplished and an NVG IP is in the front seat.  (T-1). 
3.28.5.  Radio Calls. Flight leads will direct donning of NVGs and final raising/stowing of 
NVGs. (T-1). All flight members will advise when donning, raising, or stowing NVGs  during 
other phases of flight. (T-3). 
3.28.6.  Obstacle/Intra -Flight  Deconfliction. When  flying  in route, only one flight  member  per 
element will don/raise/stow NVGs at a time. (T -1). Flight leads will call turns if forced to 
maneuver while flight members are donning/raising/stowing NVGs. (T-1). 
3.28.7.  Takeoffs/Landings. Pilots must stow or raise NVGs during takeoff until at or above 
2,000 feet AGL in climbing or level flight and only in VMC. (T -1). Pilots must stow or raise 
NVGs no later than 5 minutes prior to l anding unless NVGs are necessary to handle an 
emergency or mission requirements dictate.  (T-1). 
3.28.8.  NVG Use during Air to Air Refueling  (AAR).  Pilots  must  stow  or raise NVGs  no later 
than the stern position and resume NVG use no earlier than boom disconnect. (T-1). 
 
Section 3F —Other  
 
3.29. Targeting Pod Operations. Pilots will not use the TGP for anything other than navigational 
SA below 1,000 feet AGL (e.g., Only VID aircraft, designate for weapons delivery, etc. above 
1,000 feet AGL). (T -1). (USAFWC, Test, and AAT C: Minimum altitudes for TGP  
28 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
operations are established in WIC or test syllabus requirements, continuation training plans or 
operational test and evaluation requirements).  
3.30. Radio Procedures. Flight members must preface all communications wi th the complete 
flight call sign (except for wingman acknowledgment). (T -1). Flight members must transmit only 
that information essential for mission accomplishment or safety of flight.  (T-1). 
3.30.1.  Radio Checks. Flight members must acknowledge radio checks, whi ch do not require 
the transmission  of specific data by individual  flight  members,  in turn (EXAMPLE:  "2, 3, 4"). 
(T-1). Acknowledgment indicates the appropriate action is either complete, is in the process 
of being completed or is understood by the flight  member.  
3.30.2.  Clearance Acknowledgement. All flight members will acknowledge understanding the 
initial air traffic control (ATC) clearance. (T -1). If flight members are not monitoring in - flight 
ATC frequency, the flight lead will pass all ATC instructions to the flight. (T -1). Flight 
members  will acknowledge  subsequent  ATC instructions  when  directed  by the flight  lead. (T- 
1). 
3.30.3.  Flight members will use brevity code and other terminology IAW AFI 11- 214 and 
AFTTP 3 -1, Integrated Planning and Employment. (T -3). Other , officially published 
documents  containing brevity codes  (i.e., Air Land  Sea Application  Center) may also be used.  
3.30.4.  Ops Checks.  
3.30.4.1.  Pilots will monitor the fuel system carefully to identify low fuel, trapped fuel or 
an out of balance situation as soon as possible. (T-1). Frequency should be increased during 
tactical maneuvering at high power settings. Pilots must complete the following ops 
checks:  
3.30.4.1.1.  During climb or at level -off after takeoff. (T -1). 
3.30.4.1.2. When external fuel tanks (if carried) are empty. (T -1). 
3.30.4.1.3. Prior to each (D)ACBT engagement or intercept. (T-1). 
3.30.4.1.4. Prior to entering  an air-to-surface range,  once while  on the range  if multiple 
passes are made and after departing the range.  (T-1). 
3.30.4.2.  Pilots must check the minimum items of engine instruments, total and internal 
fuel quantities/balance, G -suit connection, oxygen system, validity of standby attitude 
indicator, and, cabin altitude. (T-1). If the G -suit malfunctions or becomes disconnected, 
pilots  will terminate  all ACBT  maneuvering until normal  operation is reestablished. (T -1). 
3.30.4.3.  For formation  flights,  the flight  lead will initiate  ops checks  by radio  call or visual 
signal. (T-1). Flight members will respond by radio call or visual signal. (T-1). 
3.30.4.3.1.  During Ops checks, pilots will ensure the fuel quantity selector knob is 
returned to the NORM position. (T -1). Totalizer -only Ops checks may be used 
periodically during high demand phases of  flight.  
3.30.4.3.2.  For mandatory ops checks when external tanks are c arried, each flight 
member will check the external tank(s) and add “Tank(s) feeding/dry” to the Ops Check. (T-1). Once the tank(s) have been confirmed and called dry, this may be omitted 
from subsequent ops  checks.  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  29  
3.30.4.3.3.  Pilots will not substitu te data -linked fuel status for operations checks. (T- 
1). 
3.31. Lap Belts. Use extreme caution when disconnecting the lap belt in flight due to potential 
for lap belt buckle/side -stick controller/throttle  interference.  
3.32. Change of Aircraft Control. Both pilots of an F -16B/D must know at all times who has 
control of the aircraft. (T -1). Pilots will transfer control of the aircraft with the statement "You 
have the aircraft." (T -1). The pilot receiving control of the aircraft will acknowledge "I have th e 
aircraft." (T -1). Once assuming control of the aircraft, the pilot will maintain control until 
relinquishing it as stated above. (T -1). Exception: If the intercom fails, the pilot in the front cockpit 
(if not in control of the aircraft) will rock the win gs and assume control of the aircraft, radios and 
navigational equipment unless briefed otherwise.  (T-3). 
3.33. Fuel  Requirements.  
3.33.1.  Joker Fuel. A briefed fuel quantity needed to terminate an event and proceed with the 
remainder of the  mission. 
3.33.2.  Bingo Fuel. A brief ed fuel state which allows the aircraft to return to the base of 
intended landing or alternate, if required, using preplanned recovery parameters and arriving 
with normal recovery fuel as listed  below:  
3.33.3.  Normal Recovery Fuel. The fuel quantity on initial or at the FAF at the base of intended  
landing or alternate,  if required. This fuel quantity is the higher  of what  is established locally  
or: 
3.33.3.1.  All F -16 Blocks 10 through 32 -  1,000 pounds.  
3.33.3.2.  All F -16 Blocks 40 and higher -  1,200 pounds. 
3.33.4.  Minimum/Emergency Fuel. Pi lots will declare the following when it becomes apparent 
that an aircraft is entering initial or start an instrument final approach at the base of intended landing or alternate, if required, with:  (T-1). 
3.33.4.1.  Minimum  Fuel:  
3.33.4.1.1.  All F -16 Blocks 10 through 32 -  800 pounds or less. 
3.33.4.1.2. All F -16 Blocks 40 and higher -  1,000 pounds or  less. 
3.33.4.2.  Emergency  Fuel:  
3.33.4.2.1.  All F -16 Blocks 10 through 32 -  600 pounds or less. 
3.33.4.2.2. All F -16 Blocks 40 and higher -  800 pounds or  less. 
3.33.5.  Afterburner Use. Pilots will not use AB be low 2,000 pounds total fuel or established 
bingo fuel, whichever is higher, unless required for safety of flight. (T-1). 
3.34. Radar Altimeters and Terrain Warning/Avoidance Systems.  
3.34.1.  If the aircraft is equipped with such systems (CARA, DTS, PGCAS, AGCAS, etc.), 
the pilot will turn them on for all flights and set LIS altitude advisory as appropriate on all missions.  (T-1). Pilots  will enable  PGCAS  with a minimum  altitude  setting  of 200 feet for day 
operations and 700 feet for night operations. (T -1). Pilots will c onfirm the correct AGCAS 
mode  (NORM/MIN/SHOW) is selected  per mission  requirements.  (T-1). AGCAS  should only 
30 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
be turned off if a known system malfunction affecting safety of flight requires system 
deactivation. Pilots will ensure that the appropriate values are set prior to takeoff. (T -1). For 
low altitude  operations  GCAS  settings,  reference paragraph  3.15.2.2 and paragraph  3.15.2.3  
in this  publication.  
3.34.2.  Pilots must set the ALOW function of the radar altimeter and the LIS at the briefed 
minimum altitude, the command- directed minimum altitude, or as briefed, whichever is 
highest. (T-1). They should be set at sufficient altitudes, during various phases of flight, to 
allow for safe recovery of the aircraft when  activated.  
3.34.3.  Prior to commencing an approach during night or IMC, pilots should reset the LIS 
and/or  ALOW  warning system  to an altitude  appropriate  to the instrument  approach  procedure 
being flown  or the general  terminal area.  Refer  to 1F-16C/CM -34-1-1, Avionic  and Nonnuclear 
Weapons Delivery Flight Manual, for warning limitations when the gear is  down. 
3.35. Wind and Sea State Restrictions. Pilots will not conduct training missions when surface 
winds  along the intended route  of flight exceed  35 knots  steady  state.  (T-1). Pilots  will not conduct 
over water  training  missions  when  surface winds  exceed  25 knots  steady  state or when  the sea state 
exceeds 10 feet (or 4 meters- USAFE). (T- 3). This is not intended to restrict operations when only 
a small portion of the route is  affected.  
3.36. Airborne Interrogator Friend Foe (AIFF)  Operation.  
3.36.1.  To reduce the potential for adverse effects on Combat Identification, Air Traffic 
Control, and Traffic Collision Avoidance systems, pilots will limit interrogations to the minimum required for th e mission.  (T-1). 
3.36.2.  For AIFF operations within the United States and its Possessions (US&P), pilots will 
comply with the equipment and operational restrictions as specified in the applicable radio frequency authorizations (RFAs) which can be obtained from the unit spectrum management office.  (T-1).

4.1. General.  Chapter 4 
INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES  
4.1.1. Head -Up Display (HUD) Use. Regardless of Block, pilots will use the ADI as the 
primary reference to recover from an unusual attitude or while executing lost wingman 
procedures. (T-1). The HUD should be used as a crosscheck in these situations. The HUD  in 
F-16 Block 25/30/32 aircraft and Block 40/42/50/52 aircraft has been certified as a primary 
flight instrument and may be used as a primary flight reference in night/IMC conditions. The 
HUD in all other F -16 Blocks may be used as an additional instrument ref erence only. No F - 
16 Block may use the HUD as the sole reference in night/IMC conditions. Pilots are required 
to also check the validity of the standby attitude indicator prior to IMC flight. (T-2). 
4.1.2. The F- 16 is approved for RNAV 2 and BRNAV for enroute na vigation IAW with 
advisory circular (AC) 90 -108 change 1, Use of Suitable Area Navigation (RNAV) Systems  on 
Conventional  Routes  and Procedures  and international  civil aviation  organization (ICAO)  Doc 
7300, Convention on International Civil Aviation. RNAV w aypoints, routes and NAVAIDs 
must  be pulled  from  a valid  and certified  database,  e.g., Digital Aeronautical  Flight Information 
File, by name. Terminal area RNAV procedures, (RNAV approaches, missed approaches, arrivals  and departures)  are not authorized  until such a time as the procedure  in its entirety  can 
be pulled by name from an approved database and auto sequenced during the  procedure. 
4.1.3. Simulated Instrument Flight. Follow AFI11 -202V3 guidance. A qualified safety 
observer must be in the aircraft or in  a chase aircraft when conducting simulated instrument 
flight. (T -1). A safety observer may occupy either seat of the F -16B/D provided the intercom 
is operable. Use the radar to aid in clearing the area. Pilots in F -16A/C aircraft may not log 
simulated ins trument flight without a chase. They may fly multiple approaches in VMC 
without  a chase,  but pilots  should place  their primary  emphasis on seeing/sensing  and avoiding 
other  aircraft.  
4.2. Takeoff and Initial Join -up. If weather is below 1,500 foot ceiling and 3 statute miles (5 
km) visibility, each aircraft will climb on takeoff heading to 1,000 feet AGL before initiating any turns, except when departure instructions specifically preclude compliance.  (T-1). 
4.3. Trail  Procedures.  
4.3.1. General. During trail formations, bas ic instrument flying is the first priority and is not 
to be sacrificed  when  performing secondary  trail tasks.  Pilots  will strictly  adhere  to the briefed 
airspeeds, power settings, altitudes, headings and turn points. (T -1). If task saturation occurs, 
pilots will cease attempts to maintain radar contact, immediately concentrate on flying the instrument procedure, and then notify the flight lead. (T -1). The flight lead will notify ATC. 
(T-1). 
4.3.1.1.  Flight leaders will request non -standard formation from ATC. (T-1). 
4.3.1.2.  ATC instructions issued to the lead aircraft apply to the entire flight. The flight 
lead should ensure ATC states when trailing wingmen/elements climb or descend. In lieu of guidance, trailing flight members will climb/descend at the same geo -locatio n that lead 
starts a climb or descent. (T -1). 
32 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
4.3.1.3.  Normal spacing is 2- 3 NM. 
4.3.1.4.  Each aircraft and element will follow the No Radar Contact procedures until the 
aircraft or element immediately in trail has radar contact and called "tied." (T-1). 
4.3.2. No Radar  Contact.  
4.3.2.1.  The flight  leader  will call initiating  all turns. (T-1). Subsequent  aircraft  must  delay 
turns to maintain the desired spacing. (T -1). 
4.3.2.2.  Each aircraft and element will maintain 20 seconds or 2 -3 NM spacing using all 
available aircraft systems and navigational aids to monitor position. (T-1). 
4.3.2.3.  During climbs and descents, each aircraft or element will call passing each 5,000 
foot altitude incr ement with altitude and heading (or heading passing) until join -up, level - 
off, or the following aircraft or element calls "tied." (T-1). 
4.3.2.4.  Each aircraft and element will call initiating any altitude or heading change. (T - 
1). Acknowledgments are not require d; however, it is imperative that preceding aircraft or 
elements monitor the radio transmissions and progress of the succeeding aircraft and 
elements, and immediately correct deviations from the planned  route.  
4.3.2.5.  Each  aircraft  and element  will maintain  at least 1,000 feet vertical  separation  from 
the preceding aircraft or element until establishing radar or visual contact, except in 
instances where departure instructions specifically preclude compliance. (T -1). Reduce 
vertical separation to 500 feet if necessary to comply with MSA  restrictions.  
4.3.2.6.  In the event a visual join- up cannot be accomplished on top or at level -off, the 
flight  leader  will request  altitude  separation  for each succeeding  aircraft  or element  to meet 
the requirements of the above paragraph. (T-1). 
4.3.3. Radar  Contact.  
4.3.3.1.  Each aircraft and element will call "tied" when radar contact is established with 
the preceding aircraft.  (T-1). Once  all aircraft are tied, no further  radio  calls are necessary, 
except to acknowledge ATC instructions, unless radar contact is  lost. 
4.3.3.2.  In flights of three or more aircraft, pilots will use all available aircraft systems 
(i.e., radar,  TACAN,  AAI,  etc.) to ensure  that trail is maintained  on the correct  aircraft.  (T- 
1). 
4.3.4. Trail Departures.  
4.3.4.1.  Pilots will use a minimum of 20 seconds takeoff spacing. (T-1). 
4.3.4.2.  Each aircraft/element will accelerate in MIL or AB power until reaching 350 
KCAS (or as required by local procedures). (T -1). Upon reaching this speed, the flight 
leader  will set a pre-briefed  power  setting. (T-1). Climb  at 350 KCAS  until reaching cruise 
Mach/TAS, unless otherwise briefed.  
4.3.4.3.  Pilots will make all turns using 30 degrees of bank. (T-1). 
4.3.5. Enroute  Trail.  Flight  leads  must  brief  airspeeds,  power  settings,  and configurations. (T- 
1). 
4.3.6. Trail Recovery.  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  33  
4.3.6.1.  Trail recoveries are only authorized at locations where procedures have been 
established. Appropriate ATC agencies must approve. (T -1). OG/CCs must ensure trail 
recovery procedures  are included in local  procedures. (T-3). As a minimum,  OG/CCs  must 
ensure procedures address each recovery profile, missed approach, climb -out, desired and 
maximum spacing requirements, lost contact and lost communications. (T-1). 
4.3.6.2.  OG/CCs must limit trail recovery to a maximum of four aircraft.  (T-1). 
4.3.6.3.  Trail recoveries are authorized when weather at the base of intended landing is at 
or above  the highest  pilot weather  category  in the flight  or approach  minimums,  whichever 
is higher.  
4.3.6.4.  The flight lead must brief the flight on spacing, configuration and airspeeds. (T - 
1). 
4.3.6.5.  The flight lead must coordinate the trail recovery with ATC prior to taking 
spacing. (T -1). 
4.3.6.6.  Prior to wingmen taking spacing for the trail recovery, the flight lead will ensure 
that all wingmen have operative navigational aids and radar. (T-1). 
4.3.6.7.  Accomplish fligh t separation IAW local directives and in VMC if possible.  
4.3.6.8.  The formation must squawk as directed by ATC. (T-1). 
4.3.6.9.  ATC will provide radar flight following for the entire formation.  (T-1). 
4.3.6.10.  Pilots must limit all turns to a maximum of 30 degrees of bank. (T-1). 
4.3.6.11.  Once established on a segment of a published approach, each aircraft must 
comply with all published altitudes and restrictions while maintaining in -trail separation. 
(T-1). 
4.3.6.12.  Unless local procedures establish defined reference points for airspeed and 
configur ation changes, the flight lead must direct changes by radio. (T -1). At flight lead's 
call all aircraft must simultaneously comply with the directed change.  (T-1). 
4.3.6.13.  All aircraft must report the final approach fix.  (T-1). 
4.3.6.14.  If contact  is lost with the preceding  aircraft,  the pilot will transmit "Callsign  (C/S) 
lost contact."  (T-1) The preceding  aircraft will respond with altitude,  airspeed  and heading. 
(T-1). The aircraft  will establish  altitude  deconfliction  and coordinate  a separate clearance 
with ATC.  (T-1). If contact  is lost while  established  on a segment  of a published approach, 
flight members may continue the approach, but must confirm separation via navigation 
aids. (T-1). If separation cannot be confirmed, the pilot will execute missed approach or 
climb -out as instructed by ATC. (T-1). 
4.3.6.15.  Flight leads will coordinate with local ATC prior to penetration if the trail 
recovery terminates in a precision approach radar (PAR) or airport surveillance radar (ASR) approach. (T -1). 
4.4. Formation Break -up. Pilots mus t execute formation break- up from a visual formation in 
VMC. (T -1). If IMC is unavoidable, pilots must breakup from a visual formation in straight and 
level flight. (T -1). This restriction does not apply to trail formation. Prior to an IMC break- up, the 
flight lead will confirm position and transmit attitude, altitude, airspeed, and altimeter setting.  (T- 
34 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
1). Wingmen will acknowledge and confirm good navigational aids (reception of appropriate 
TACAN, ILS and/or appropriate GPS/INS waypoint) . (T-1). 
4.5. Formation  Penetration.  
4.5.1. Pilots must restrict formation penetrations in route or close formation to two aircraft 
when the weather at the base of intended landing is less than overhead traffic pattern minimums. (T -1). 
4.5.2. Formation penetrations using radar trail procedures are authorized when weather at  the 
base of intended landing is at or above the highest pilot weather category in the flight or approach minimums, whichever is  higher.  
4.6. Formation Approach. During IMC formation flights, pilots will not change lead or wing 
positions below 1,500 feet AGL unless on radar downwind or if required during a formation approach with an F -16 experiencing an emergency. (T -1). 
4.7. Instrument Approach Procedures.  
4.7.1. Pilots  will not fly any published instrument  procedure  (e.g., DoD,  Jeppesen,  ICAO)  that 
requires airspeeds less than those specified in 1F -16C/CM -1, Flight Manual . (T-1). 
4.7.2. The F-16 is Approach Category E. If no Category E minimums  are published, Category 
D minimums can  be used, provided:  
4.7.2.1.  A straight- in approach is  flown.  
4.7.2.2.  For the final approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 165 KCAS or  less. 
4.7.2.3.  For the missed approach segment, the aircraft is flown at 260 knots true airspeed 
(KTAS)  or less. At high density altitudes  260 KTAS  may require  a KCAS  below  the speed 
specified in 1F -16C/CM -1 and pilots shall not fly Category D approaches.  (T-1).

AIR- TO-SURFACE WEAPONS EMPLOYMENT  
 
Section 6A —General  
 
6.1. General. Reference AFI 11 -214 for procedures and restrictions.  
6.2. Simulated Gun Employment. Pilots must comply with the below restrictions and 
procedures.  
6.2.1. Never  perform  a trigger check  with a hot gun, regardless of Master  Arm switch  position 
(T-1). 
6.2.2. Never perform simulated gun employment (squeezing the trigger with the Master Arm 
switch in SIM) with a hot gun (one that is not safe  IAW 1F -16C/CM -34-1-1). (T -1). This 
restriction does not apply on a controlled range against targets approved for gun employment 
with ammunition  loaded.  
6.2.3. Prior to flight, confirm the status of the gun system. (T -1). Prior to simulated gun 
employment, perfor m a trigger check with the Master Arm switch in SIMULATE and the 
aircraft pointed away from other aircraft and populated areas. (T -1). If HUD symbology reads 
“ARM” or SMS/MFD symbology reads “RDY,” do not squeeze the trigger or continue with simulated weap ons employment. (T-1). 
6.3. Training Missions with a Hot Gun.  
6.3.1. Pilots  will not select  strafe  submode  until immediately  prior  to roll in and deselect  strafe 
submode immediately after completing the safe escape maneuver.  (T-1). 
6.3.2. Before  firing  the laser,  ensure  avionics  (to include  master  arm switch,  master  mode, and 
SMS) will not allow the gun to  fire. 
6.3.3. Pilots will not disable AGCAS for strafe operations. (T -3). During LAS an automated 
recovery may occur near 2000 feet slant range; therefore pilots must cease fir e prior to 2000 
feet slant range or rounds may be employed well long of the target during automated pull -up. 
(T-1). 
6.4. Simulated Air -to-Surface Weapons  Employment.  
6.4.1. A simulated  attack  is defined  as an attack  in which  the pilot presses the weapons  release 
(pick le) button and/or pulls the trigger with the intention of conducting a dry pass.  
6.4.2. Simulated Attacks against off -Range or Manned Targets. Do not conduct such attacks 
with internally/externally loaded live ordnance (except for 20 mm ammunition with a safed gun IAW 1F -16C/CM -34-1-1), externally loaded heavyweight inert ordnance, or hung 
ordnance. When the aircraft is loaded with expendable stores (e.g., external fuel tanks, TERs carted at the pylon), load simulated weapons (zero quantity) in the SMS/MFD only on empty or uncarted/unexpendable stations (Exception: Captive Maverick and HARM missiles may be 
selected). Confirm the Master Arm switch is in OFF or SIMULATE prior to the first attack. Flight  lead will query and flight  members  will reply  to a “check  zero quantity, uncarted station” 
radio call.  (T-1). 
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  37  
6.5. Weather. In training, pilots will not conduct climbing or diving deliveries with a ceiling 
below 2,000 feet AGL or level deliveries with a ceiling below 1,500 feet AGL. (T-1). 
6.6. Pop- Up Attacks.  Pilots will abort pop -up attacks if airspeed decreases below 350 KCAS 
(300 KCAS above 10,000 feet AGL). (T-1). 
6.7. Target  Identification.  Pilots  shall  positively  identify  the target  prior to weapons  release.  (T- 
1). For wartime or contingency sorties, comply with ROE. For training sorties, achieve positive 
identification  by either  visually  acquiring the target  or by confirming target location through valid 
on-board/off -board cues.  Exercise caution  when  relying on a single  cue to confirm  target  location. 
For night training sorties when actual training, inert or live weapons will be released via a visual 
attack  mode, do not rely on visual  cues alone; confirm  visual  acquisition  of the target with at least 
one additional on- board/off -board cue before releasing weapons. Cues may include, but are not 
limited to, radar, GPS, marking rounds, TGP or IR Maverick lock on, IR pointers or NVG - 
compatible marking devices.  
6.8. Safety of Ground Personnel. When ground controllers are present on Class B/C ranges, 
range personnel wi ll brief pilots on locations of these personnel. (T-1). Each pilot will 
acknowledge. (T-1). Pilots  must  know  applicable  range  weapons  delivery  procedures, appropriate 
targets and weapons footprints. (T -1). Pilots shall not expend ordnance if any doubt exists as to 
the ground personnel or intended target locations. (T -1). 
 
Section 6B —Night  
 
6.9. Altitude.  Compute an MSA for the entire bombing pattern using the guidance in AFI 11-

ABNORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES  
 
7.1. General.  Follow  the procedures  in this chapter  when  other  than normal  circumstances occur. 
These procedures do not supersede procedures contained in the flight manual. Pilots  will: 
7.1.1. Not accept an aircraft for flight with a malfunction which is addressed in the 
emergency/abnormal procedures section of the flight manual until appropriate corrective 
actions have been accomplished. (T-1). 
7.1.2. Not fly an aircraft  with a tripped  engine  monitoring  system  (EMS)  Go-No-Go indicator 
(Bit Ball)  until maintenance  has accomplished  the appropriate  procedures  and cleared  the fault. 
(T-1). 
7.1.3. Not taxi with a known malfunction of the nose-wheel  steering  system,  the brake  system, 
or a generator. Note: F-16C/D aircraft may be taxied with a single generator failure (main or 
standby) if the other generator is operating normally.  (T-1). 
7.1.4. Once a malfunctioning aircraft system is isolated, do not use that system again unless 
its use in a degraded mode is essen tial for recovery. (T -1). Pilots will not conduct ground or 
in-flight trouble -shooting after flight manual emergency procedures are complete. (T-1). 
7.1.5. In the F -16B/D, the pilot in command is primarily responsible for handling in- flight 
emergencies. The addit ional pilot will confirm that all critical action procedures have been 
accomplished and provide checklist assistance at the request of the pilot in command.  (T-1). 
7.1.6. For actual/perceived  flight  control  malfunctions,  pilots  will terminate  maneuvering  and 
take appropriate action. (T -1). If the problem was due to crew/passenger stick or rudder 
interference,  the pilot will take positive  action  to ensure  no further  control  interference  occurs. 
(T-1). 
7.1.7. When a fuel imbalance exceeds dash one limits, terminate tactical maneuvering and 
investigate. (T-1). If the problem was caused by a slow feeding external or internal fuel tank 
and can be corrected, the mission may continue IAW 1F -16C/CM -1. If not, termina te the 
mission. Instruments, deployment missions, level weapons deliveries and straight -through-  
non-maneuvering intercepts are authorized to reduce gross weight until a safe landing is 
possible.  
7.2. Critical Action Procedures (CAPs). General. Pilots will be e valuated on the following  
Table 7.1 procedures IAW MAJCOM guidelines. (T -1). Pilots shall be able to immediately 
accomplish these procedures in the published sequence without reference to the checklist. (T -1). 
Certain steps ( e.g., Stores -  Jettison) may be performed out of sequence, if conditions warrant. 
CAPs may be abbreviated when written, but pilots must convey clear procedural intent. (T-1).

7.3. Ground Aborts.  
7.3.1. If a flight member aborts prior to takeoff, the flight lead normally renumbers the flight 
to maintain a numerical call sign sequence. Flight leads will advise the appropriate agencies of 
such changes. (T -1). 
7.3.2. Pilots  who do not takeoff  with the flight  may join the flight  in accordance  with the brief 
or flight lead instructions. If a join -up is to be accomplished on an air -to-ground range, the 
flight lead must terminate all events until the joining aircraft has achieved proper spacing. (T - 
1). 
7.4. Takeoff  Aborts.  
7.4.1. If an abort  occurs  during  takeoff  roll, the aborting pilot must  say call sign and intentions 
when practical. (T -1). Following aircraft will alter takeoff roll to ensure clearance or abort 
takeoff if adequate clearance cannot be maintained. (T -1). Pilots must use the phrase "Cable, 
Cable, Cable" to indicate a departure -end cable arrestment. (T -1). Pilots must use the phrase 
"Barrier, Barrier, Barrier" to indicate a departure -end net arrestment. (T -1). Group/CCs will 
establish local cable and barrier  procedures. (T-1). 
7.4.2. When aborting above 120 KCAS, or whenever hot brakes are suspected, pilots will 
declare a ground emergency, taxi the aircraft to the designated hot brake area and follow hot brake procedures. (T-1). 
7.4.3. If aborting at or above 100 KCAS, pil ots will lower the hook. (T -1). If aborting below 
100 KCAS, pilots will lower the hook if there is any doubt about the ability to stop on the remaining runway. (T-1). 
7.5. Air Aborts.  
7.5.1. If an abort occurs after takeoff, all aircraft will maintain their original n umerical call 
sign. (T-1). 
7.5.2. Escort aborting aircraft with an emergency condition to the field of intended landing. 
When other than an emergency condition exists, the flight lead will determine if an escort for the aborting aircraft is necessary.  (T-3). 
7.5.3. Pilots will abort the mission, regardless of apparent damage or subsequent normal 
operation, for any of the  following:  
7.5.3.1.  Bird strike  (T-1). 
7.5.3.2.  Actual or suspected foreign object damage.  (T-1). 
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  41  
7.5.3.3.  Recovery below FRAG altitude with live ordnance. (T-1). 
7.5.3.4.  Moderate to severe icing.  (T-1). 
7.5.3.5.  Over -G. Note: Land as soon as practical out of a straight -in approach. (T-1). 
7.5.3.6.  Flight control system anomalies, including un- commanded departures from 
controlled  flight.  (T-1). Exception:  intentional  departures from  controlled  flight  conducted 
IAW a MAJCOM -approved syllabus, but not including flight control system lights that 
reset IAW flight manual procedures.  
7.5.3.7.  Engine flameout/stagnation or shutdown. (T-1). 
7.5.3.8.  Lightning strike. (T-1). 
7.6. Radio Failure/No Radio (NORDO).  Refe rence AFPAM 11 -205 and the Flight Information 
Handbook. 
7.6.1. NORDO in  Formation. 
7.6.1.1.  A pilot who experiences total radio failure while in close or route formation will 
maneuver within close/route parameters to attract the attention of another flight member 
and give  the appropriate visual signals. (T-1). The mission should be terminated as soon as 
practical and the NORDO aircraft led to the base of intended landing or a divert base. A formation approach to a drop- off on final should be performed unless safety conside rations 
dictate  otherwise. 
7.6.1.2.  If flying other than close/route formation when radio failure occurs, the NORDO 
aircraft should attempt to rejoin to a route position at approximately 500 feet on another flight member. The NORDO aircraft is responsible for maintaining clearances from  other 
flight members until his presence is acknowledged by a wingrock, signifying clearance to join. Once joined, the NORDO aircraft will give the appropriate visual signals. (T -1). If 
pre-briefed, the NORDO aircraft may proceed to a rendezvous point and hold. If no one 
has rejoined prior to reaching bingo fuel, the NORDO aircraft should proceed to the base of intended landing or a divert base. Aircraft experiencing any difficulty/emergency in addition to NORDO will proceed as required by the situation.  (T-1). 
7.6.2. NORDO on a Class A Range or a Manned Class B  Range. 
7.6.2.1.  Pilots  will attempt  contact  with the range  control  officer  (RCO)  on the appropriate 
back -up frequency or back up radio. (T-1). 
7.6.2.2.  If contact cannot be reestablished, pilots will make a pass by the range control 
tower on the attack heading while rocking wings and turn in the direction of traffic. (T -1). 
The flight lead will direct another flight member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight and RTB. (T-1). 
7.6.2.3.  If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, the NORDO aircraft will make a pass 
by the range control tower, if practical, on the attack heading while rocking wings, turn opposite  the direction  of traffic,  and proceed  to a recovery  base.  (T-1). The flight  lead will 
direct a flight member to join -up and escort the emergency aircraft.  (T-1). 
7.6.3. NORDO on an Unmanned Class B Range or on a Class C  Range. 
42 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
7.6.3.1.  The NORDO aircraft will make a pass on the target maintaining normal pattern 
spacing, if possible, while rocking wings. (T -1). The flight lead will direct another flight 
member to escort the NORDO aircraft to a recovery base or rejoin the flight in sequence 
and recover. (T -1). If the NORDO aircraft has an emergency, if practical, it will make a 
pass on the target maintaining normal pattern spacing, rocking wings, turn opposite direction  of traffic  and proceed  to a recovery base.  (T-1). The flight  lead will direct  a flight 
member to join- up and escort the emergency aircraft. (T-1). 
7.6.3.2.  Unexpended Ordnance. If radio failure occurs and circumstances preclude landing 
with unexpended ordnance, safe jettison of ordnance may be accomplished provided the following conditions are  met: 
7.6.3.2.1.  The NORDO aircraft joins on another flight member who has radio contact 
with the RCO and the remainder of the  flight.  
7.6.3.2.2.  Stores jettison visual signals specified in AFPAM 11 -205 are relayed to the 
NORDO aircraft to initiate  jettison.  
7.6.4. NORDO during Missile or Air- to-Air Gunnery Firing.  
7.6.4.1.  Aircraft will not fire without two -way radio contact. (T-1). 
7.6.4.2.  If radio failure occurs, the pilot will safe the armament switches, join on another 
member of the flight or the tow aircraft, IAW paragraph 7.6.1 (T-1). 
7.6.4.3.  Gunnery target tow aircraft experiencing radio failure will rock wings and 
continue the turn if an attack is in progress. (T -1). The flight lead of the attacking aircraft 
will join on the tow's wing. (T -1). Remain clear o f the banner in the event it is cut. The tow 
pilot will use standard hand signals to indicate his difficulty. (T -1). The flight lead will 
signal when the banner is cleared for cut with a slicing motion across the throat. (T- 1). 
After the banner is away an d the flight lead determines there is no remaining cable,  he will 
take the lead, RTB with the tow aircraft on the wing, advise the tower of the  NORDO and 
establish the appropriate landing pattern. (T-1). If cable remains, follow local procedures.  
7.6.5. NORDO during Recovery. 
7.6.5.1.  If a formation straight- in approach is flown and a go- around becomes necessary, 
the chase will go -around, pass the NORDO aircraft and rock his wings. (T -1). The NORDO 
aircraft will go -around, if the situation allows. (T-1). If the NORDO ai rcraft is in  formation  
as a wingman, the leader  will initiate  a gentle  turn into the wingman  and begin the go- around.  
(T-1). 
7.6.5.2.  To signal  the need  for an approach -end arrestment,  the pilot will lower  the tailhook 
(visual formation) or fly a straight in approach flashing the landing light (unescorted). (T - 
1). 
7.7. Severe Weather Penetration. Do not fly through severe weather. (T -2). If unavoidable, 
flights will split -up and obtain separate clearances prior to s evere weather penetration.  (T-2). 
7.8. Spatial Disorientation (SD). SD has proven to be a leading killer of F -16 pilots. Although 
SD is most  common  at night  or in IMC,  it can and has happened in day VMC.  Reference  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  43  
AFPAM11 -417, Orientation  in Aviation , for information on the causes of SD, how to avoid it, and 
how to mitigate its  consequences.  
7.8.1. Enabling PARS is an acceptable recovery method from SD induced unusual attitudes, 
reference AFTTP 3 -3.F16 for recommended throttle techniques during PARS  recoveries.  
7.8.2. Pilots should ensure deconfliction from other aircraft (primarily above or below their 
position) prior to PARS  activation.  
7.9. Lost  Wingman. 
7.9.1. Priorities.  The first priority  is to establish  safe separation  from other  aircraft  (e.g., tanker 
or wingman). Next, obtain a separate clearance to ensure obstacle/terrain clearance and 
clearance from other traffic.  
7.9.2. Prohibitions. Do not practice lost wingman procedures in other than day VMC 
conditions.  
7.9.3. General Procedures. Simultaneously transition to inst ruments and inform lead while 
executing lost wingman procedures (ref AFTTP 3- 3.F16 for amplifying data). Lead will 
acknowledge the radio call and transmit attitude, heading, altitude and airspeed. (T -1). Once 
lost wingman procedures have been executed, per mission to rejoin must be obtained from the 
flight lead.  (T-1). 
7.9.4. Two- or Three -Ship Flights. Note: If in three -ship echelon, refer to four -ship lost 
wingman  procedures.  
7.9.4.1.  Wings -Level Flight (climb, descent or straight and level). Simultaneously inform 
the leader and turn away using 15 degrees of bank for 15 seconds, then resume heading 
and obtain a separate  clearance.  
7.9.4.2.  Outside the Turn. Reverse the direction of turn using 15 degrees of bank for 15 
seconds and inform the leader. Continue straight ahead to ensure  separation prior to 
resuming the turn. Obtain a separate  clearance.  
7.9.4.3.  Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose -tail separation and 
inform the flight lead to roll out of the turn. Maintain angle of bank to ensure lateral separation and obtain  a separate clearance. The leader may resume turn only when 
separation is  ensured.  
7.9.4.4.  Precision/Non -precision Final. The wingman will momentarily turn away to 
ensure clearance, inform lead, and commence the published missed approach procedure while obtaining a separate clearance.  (T-1). 
7.9.4.5.  Missed  Approach. The wingman  will momentarily  turn away  to ensure  clearance, 
inform lead, and continue the published or assigned missed approach procedure while climbing to 500 feet above missed approach altitude. (T -1). Obtain  a separate clearance.  
7.9.5. Four -Ship Flights. If only one aircraft in the flight becomes separated, the previous 
procedures would provide safe separation, but since it is impossible for number 4 to immediately ascertain that number 3 still has visual contact w ith the leader, it is imperative 
that number 4's initial action be based on the assumption that number 3 has also become separated. Numbers 2 and 3 will follow the procedures outlined above. (T -1). Number 4  will 
follow the appropriate procedure listed below:  (T-1). 
44 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
7.9.5.1.  Wings -Level Flight. Simultaneously inform the leader and turn away using 30 
degrees of bank for 30 seconds, then resume heading and obtain a separate  clearance.  
7.9.5.2.  Outside the Turn. Reverse direction of turn using 30 degrees of bank for 30 
seconds to ensure separation from lead and number 3 and obtain a separate  clearance.  
7.9.5.3.  Inside the Turn. Momentarily reduce power to ensure nose -tail separation and 
increase bank angle by 15 degrees. Inform the leader to roll out. Obtain a separate 
clearance. Leader will resume turn only when separation is ensured. (T-1). 
7.10. Armament System  Malfunctions.  
7.10.1.  General. Do not attempt to expend ordnance using a weapons release system with a 
known malfunction. If abnormal missile launch or erratic missile flight occurs, have the 
launching aircraft visually inspected by a chase pilot, if possible, to determine if any damage has occurred.  
7.10.2.  Inadvertent Release. Record switch positions at the time of inadvertent release and 
impact  point, if known, and provide  the information to debrief  personnel. Check  switches safe 
and do not attempt further release in any mode. Treat remaining stores as hung and obtain a chase aircraft for RTB, if practical.  If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a 
suitable ar ea on a single pass, if  practical.  
7.10.3.  Hung Freefall Ordnance or Missile Hangfire/Misfire. First confirm switches/SMS 
settings were correct. If they were, record all relevant switch/SMS settings and proceed as follows. 
7.10.3.1.  Hung Live Freefall Ordnance. Attempt deli very using an alternate delivery 
mode, if applicable. If unsuccessful, use selective jettison procedures for the store. If 
unsuccessful and the ordnance is either unsecure or the security of the ordnance cannot be determined, consider selective jettison of  the rack.  
7.10.3.2.  Hung Practice/Inert Freefall Ordnance. Make an additional attempt to expend. If 
unsuccessful, select an alternate delivery mode and try again. If unsuccessful,  ordnance 
from other stations/dispensers may be released provided this does not violat e load 
symmetry limits. If remaining stores present a recovery hazard, jettison in a suitable area 
on a single pass, if  practical.  
7.10.3.3.  Maverick Missile Hangfire. A missile that fires but fails to depart the aircraft is 
a hangfire. If able, have a chase pilot i nspect such a missile.  
7.10.3.4.  Maverick Missile Misfire. A missile that fails to fire when all appropriate 
switches were selected is a misfire. If this occurs, safe the Master Arm switch. If able, have a chase pilot inspect the missile for smoke or fire. If either  exists, jettison the missile on 
the range. If not, pilots may attempt another pass. If the second attempt fails and conditions permit, remain dry in the pattern for 15 minutes, then proceed to the recovery base following hung ordnance/weapons malfunction recovery procedures.  
7.10.3.5.  Hung Ordnance/Weapons Malfunction Recovery Procedures. Visually inspect 
the aircraft for damage, if practical. Declare an emergency (not required for hung 
practice/inert ordnance or hung rockets). Obtain a chase aircraft, if available. Avoid 
populated areas and trail formations. Land from a straight -in approach.  
AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  45  
7.11. In-flight Practice of Emergency Procedures. Reference AFI 11 -202V3, para 3.32. A 
simulated emergency procedure is any procedure that produces an effect closely paralleling the 
actual emergency. One example would be retarding the throttle sufficiently to emulate the performance of an aircraft with a flamed out or idle  engine.  
7.11.1.  Prohibitions. Do not practice aborted takeoffs in the aircraft. (T -1). Instead, use the 
flight simulator,  Cockpit  Familiarization  Trainer or a static  aircraft,  in that order  of preference. 
Do not practice in -flight engine shutdown. (T-1). Do not practice SFO patterns unless crash 
rescue is available and either an active tower or a runway operations monitor (ROM) or equivalent, e.g., SOF,  is in operation. (T-1). Pilots  will not practice  SFO patterns  in conditions 
other than day VMC. (T-1). 
7.11.2.  Simulated Flameout (SFO)/Emergency Landing Patterns. OG/CCs will establish 
specific procedures for SFO trai ning and establish letters of agreement with appropriate 
agencies. (T -1). They will publish those procedures in their supplement to this volume. (T -1). 
General SFO procedures  follow:  
7.11.2.1.  The SFO pattern may be entered from any direction or altitude that ensures the 
aircraft is properly configured above 2,000 feet AGL and in a position to safely complete the approach. 
7.11.2.2.  Do not initiate  or continue  an SFO if a potential  traffic  pattern  conflict  exists  that 
would require  division of the pilot’s  attention  between  the SFO and sequencing with traffic. 
(T-2). Discontinue an SFO whenever excessive maneuvering is required, whether as a 
result  of a traffic  conflict  or when  making corrections. (T-2). Discontinue  an SFO if unable 
to obtain wings level on final by 200 feet AGL. (T -2). Discontinue an SFO if airspeed 
drops below Dash One minimum airspeed any time between base key and the initiation of the flare. (T-2). Once the decision to discontinue an SFO has been made, initiate a go-  
around and do not attempt to re sume the SFO.  (T-2). 
7.11.2.3.  Except when operating IAW a MAJCOM -approved syllabus (e.g., AFMC high 
angle of attack training), do not touch down from an SFO. (T -2). 
7.11.2.4.  Make radio calls IAW local procedures, but as a minimum call: 
7.11.2.4.1. "High Key"  
7.11.2.4.2.  "Low  Key"  
7.11.2.4.3.  "Base Key, Gear Down,  (Intentions)"  
7.12. Search and Rescue (SAR) Procedures. General directive procedures are listed below. 
OG/CCs will establish specific procedures in the unit supplement to this volume. (T-1). 
7.12.1.  Squawk. Immediately cease tactical maneuvering by executing Knock- It-Off 
procedures. Place IFF to EMER to alert ATC/GCI/AWACS of the emergency  situation.  
7.12.2.  Talk. Establish an on scene commander (OSC). Communicate the emergency situation 
and intentions immediately to applicable control agencies. Use GUARD frequency if  
necessary.  
7.12.3.  Mark.  Mark  the last known position of survivors/crash site using any means available, 
e.g., visual ground references, TACAN, INS, EGI, ATC/GCI/AWACS, HMCS, or TGP. Pass this information to follow -on SAR  forces.  
46 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020   
7.12.4.  Separate. Remain above the last observed parachute altitudes until the position of all 
possible survivors is determined. If visual contact with parachute is not maintained, allow 
approximately 1 minute  per thousand  feet (16 feet per second)  for parachute  descent.  The OSC 
will establish deconfliction between all aircraft involved in the SAR. (T-1). 
7.12.5.  Update Bingo/Recovery Base. Revise bingo fuels or recovery bases as required to 
maintain maximum SAR coverage over survivor(s). Pilots will not overfly bingo. (T -1). 
Relinquish OSC duties  to more  qualified  rescue forces (e.g., SANDY 1, US Coast  Guard)  upon 
their arrival.  
7.12.6.  For overwater SAR/CSAR, OSC will utilize every means available (visual, TGP, 
Radar Ground Map, or Ground Moving Target Modes) to locate vessels that may aid in 
recovery. (T-1). 
7.13. Post Arresting Gear Engagement Procedures. Do not shut down the engine unless 
fire/other conditions  dictate  or directed  to do so by the arresting  gear crew.  (T-2). Raise  the tailhook 
on the signal from the arresting crew. Pilots will not taxi until directed to do so by the arresting 
gear crew. (T -1). 
7.14. AGCAS  and PARS  Reporting  Procedures.  Complete  and expeditious  reporting of certain 
AGCAS and PARS events is critical as it enables improvements to the AGCAS system as well as 
the addressing of anomalies that could  affect  mission  effectiveness or safe aircraft operation. Units 
will report the following AGCAS and PARS  events:  
7.14.1.  AGCAS  activations  assessed  to have  prevented or to likely  have  prevented Controlled 
Flight into Terrain (CFIT).  (T-1). 
7.14.2.  AGCAS nuisance activations that had a significant negative impact on mission 
effectiveness.  (T-1). 
7.14.3.  AGCAS  erroneous  activations or recoveries that affected  safe operation of the aircraft. 
(T-1). 
7.14.4.  PARS erroneous activations, abnormal or incompl ete recoveries, and/or PARS 
recoveries that affected the safe operation of the aircraft.  (T-1). 
7.15. For AGCAS  and PARS  events.  For AGCAS  and PARS  events that fall into the categories 
identified in paragraph 7.14, the following actions will be  taken:  
7.15.1.  HUD video 1 minute before to 30 seconds after the event will be extracted and saved.  
(T-1). 
7.15.2.  The AGCAS Log File and PCDS file (if applicable) will be downloaded and saved 
using the JMPS UPC before the ADTC is returned to service.  (T-1). 
7.15.3.  CSFDR and FDR data will be downloaded and stored. (T-1). 
7.16. Units will report AGCAS and PARS events.  Units will report AGCAS and PARS events 
listed in paragraph 7.15 via email to the “F -16/AGCAS Reporting” distribution group in the 
NIPRNET Outlook GAL. (T -1). Recipients of the report will promptly advise the unit how to 
gather and transmit the  data.

Chapter 8  
 
LOCAL OPERATING PROCEDURES  
 
8.1. General. This chapter provides a consolidated framework for wings to supplement (IAW 
AFI 33 -360) local operating procedures. Units composed of multiple aircraft types may publish 
guidance  in a single, stand -alone  local  operating instruction  instead  of supplementing this manual. 
Added or stand- alone procedures cannot be less restrictive than those contained elsewhere in this 
volume. This chapter is not intended to be a single source document for procedures contained in 
other directives or regulations. Avoid unnecessary repetition of guidance provided in other established directives; however, reference to those directives is acceptable when it serves to facilitate the location of information. This chapter is authorized to be issued to each pilot. Units will supplement the following paragraphs for local operating guidance:  
8.1.1.  Secti on A.  Introduction.  
8.1.1.1. (Added- SHAWAFB) General. This chapter supplements AFMAN  11-2F-16V3 
with guidance specific to 20 FW F -16 flying operations. This chapter must be used in 
conjunction with SHAWAFBI 11- 250, the 20 FW Pilot Aid, 20 OG  Flying Standards, and 
AFI 13 -212, Range Planning and Operations. If conflicting guidance exists between this 
instruction and other applicable publications, the most restrictive guidance  applies.  
8.1.1.2. (Added- SHAWAFB) Deviations. Deviations and waivers from operational 
directives outlined in this instruction must be approved by the 20 OG/CC unless an in-  
flight emergency precludes  requests.  
8.1.1.3. (Added- SHAWAFB) Recommendations for Change. Change proposals to this 
instruction are encouraged. Submit AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, to 20 OG/OGV through the appropriate squadron Stan/Eval Liaison Officer 
(SELO).  
8.1.2.  Section B. General  Guidance . 
8.1.2.1. (Added- SHAWAFB) In-flight Command Authority. The designated flight lead 
has responsibility for overall planning and execution of the mission , regardless of rank or 
position of other flight members. Included in this responsibility is command authority over the mission conduct. Another flight member cannot assume authority unless delegated by the flight lead or designated on the flight or ders for purposes of flight instruction or flight 
evaluation. Instructor Pilots (IPs) and Stan/Eval Flight Examiners (SEFEs) are flying supervisors and have full authority to prevent any unsafe act or operation IAW governing AFIs.  
8.1.2.2. (Added- SHAWAFB) Local Air field Operations and Procedures. SHAWAFBI 
11-250 is the primary instruction defining generic local area ground and air operating 
procedures. This supplement defines F -16 specific instructions. It is the responsibility of 
every pilot to be familiar with SHA WAFBI 11 -250 as well as this  supplement.  
8.1.2.3. (Added- SHAWAFB) Single -Ship Missions.  Instrument sorties may be flown 
single -ship to any airfield approved by the Operations Supervisor within the Shaw local 
flying area.   All other alternate missions IAW 20 OG Flying Standards.  
8.1.2.4. (Added- SHAWAFB) Bird/Wildlife Aircraft Hazard (BASH) procedures  are 
IAW SHAW  AFB PLAN 91- 212.  
48 AFMAN11 -2F-16V3 4 FEBRUARY 2020  
  
8.1.3.   Section C. Ground Operations.  
8.1.3.1. (Added- SHAWAFB) Weather/Notices to Airman (NOTAMs) Briefing. A 
weather/ NOTAMs briefing/update is required for every flight. For quick-
turns/pits/multiple flights, the Operations Supervisor and/or SOF will ensure pilots are 
informed of any significant changes to their initial weather briefing or airfield  NOTAMs.  
8.1.3.2. (Added- SHAWAFB) Environmental Restrictions. Anti -Expo sure S uits will be 
worn IAW AFI 11 - 301V2 para 2.2.2.2. Gliding distance to land is not a criteria in 
determining whether or not anti -exposure suits are to be worn. Local weather, as 
mentioned in AFI 11 - 301V1_ACCSUP, refers to the temperature over the wat er, not 
Shaw AFB air temperature.  
8.1.3.3. (Added- SHAWAFB) Military Training Routes (MTRs). Flight leads will ensure 
desired MTRs  are scheduled with the route’s scheduling authority and annotated in the 
airspace column of the daily schedule. Low Level Training Routes (LLTRs) will not  be 
bootlegge d real-time, to ensure adequate mi ssion planning foc us and prevent potential conflicts 
with aircraft flying from intersecting LLTRs.  
8.1.3.4. (Added- SHAWAFB) Required Flight Information Publications (FLIP). The 
following FLIP will be downloaded and available on an Electronic Fli ght Bag (EFB) prior 
to flight: h igh and low terminal approach books encompassing local  area and all possible
